Always greeted with a smile & given exceptional customer service. Prices are a good rate and less expensive than other places. Been a customer here for about 2 years and never had an issue. Will always keep coming here for any repairs.< /Review>

We sat here waiting 10 minutes for someone to help us... No one came to us about our tire issue or even looked our way.
We ended up going next door to the other tire place and was treated with respect! Good guys, you can do better!<//text>

<Review>Armen waiting way past closing on a saturday for me to drive down from Wawona, Ca in the mountains to drop my car off for a traction control sensor issue. This was the second time in  2 months i had to have this replaced but the opposite side last time. And i had taken it to pep boys previously. The costs was close to 80 dollars cheaper at good guys. They also found some issues with my struts that pep boys didnt tell me about last time. I have to wait
To get that fixed. All in all, excellemt customer service. Most my family use them, and ill also be a returning customer.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I used to think they were a great place to go and get my oil changed or new tires until my mom went just recently to get her oil changed. She ended up noticing her vehicle was making weird noises so she got a mechanic to check it out and found out the O2 censor had been disconnected after getting her oil changed here. Now I will never be returning here and will tell all family and friends not to come here either.</Review>

<Review>I had a major problem with my car and took it to Godguys.  As always I got nothing by A+ service from all members of the team that I came in contact with.  I especially want to express my sincere appreciation to Ron in the Front Desk area.  He went far beyond what  you usually expect when you come into contact with service people today.

Anyone that is considering any of the services or product offered by Goodguys should be sure and give them a try.  I have for over 20 years.

Keep up the great job to all of the members of the team.

Gold Coast is by far the best chiropractic center ever. Everyone is so friendly, and super informative. I enjoy going to my appointments and I feel so much better leaving too. Lorraine worked on me after my car accident and now Dr. Dave currently works on me. They both worked together to figure out what I needed in my adjustments to get me where I‚Äôm at now with no more constant pain. They are very thorough making me feel the most comfortable. Also Emily is the best! She is so great at scheduling and really works with my crazy schedule.<//Text>

<review>Talkk about a pain in the neck!!
I am 54 and been surfing over 40 years.
This past winter the pain in my neck and back was so severe I literally couldn‚Äôt surf!
I  decided to ‚Äúkick down‚Äù and get help‚Ä¶yes treatment costs $$ but I am so glad I did.
Dr. Dave and his team are amazing.
With X-rays and a lengthy consultation, he educated me on my issues and mapped out a quick and reasonable road to recovery.
His plan worked and I am back in the water!
Do I still visit Gold Coast, yes!
I saw Dr. Dave today as he‚Äôs ‚Äútuning‚Äù me up for my surf trip to El Salvador next month!!!!< /review>< Pics>

I'm so happy I came across Dr. Jacob Melendez. I woke up one morning with trouble breathing. The front desk assisted me in making an appointment that same day, and after a thorough examination of my medical and personal history along with anthropometric assessments and x-rays efficiently examined, Dr. Melendez was able to perform the perfect adjustments to relieve my pain along with explaining exactly what was occurring with my back and possible future consequences.

The whole practice amazed me. Everyone was especially friendly and answered any questions or concerns I had. There's also just something about being in a family practice that helps reach and optimal level of comfort and trust.<//text>

I absolutely love Gold Coast Chiropractic !! I‚Äôm 6 months pregnant & have been having aches and pains. I was really nervous to come at first , just because I‚Äôve never had an adjustment done while pregnant  , but the office staff and Doctors have all been so amazing !! They walked me through ever step and made sure I was comfortable at all times.  After my first adjustment I felt so good ! Dr. Lorraine and Dr. Anna are so sweet and very attentive. I definitely regret not coming sooner!! I bought a 12 session package and can‚Äôt wait to go in and get adjusted again ! My new favorite place !</Review>

My experience with Gold Coast has been absolutely nothing but wonderful. The doctors who have taken care of me (Especially Dr. Jacob Melendez) are friendly, clearly knowledge in their craft, and provide me with treatment fully personalized to helping me. The Gold Coast family views what they do as trying to help people to fully recover from injuries, or just stay healthy by addressing every piece of a patients lifestyle from physical conditioning and spinal adjustments to day to day changes. The experience even comes with a view.</text>

<Review>Thank you Dr. Anna, Grace, David and Emily, you all were professional, happy, informative and nice people. I felt taken care of just wish my visit would have included adjustments and my results for the $49 fee I found on Facebook. Otherwise I liked the office, it was clean and Covid ready. Everyone who left seemed very happy. If I am as pleased tomorrow as I was today, I will be bringing my daughter and the rest of my friends and family. Well done guys.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Chiropractic treatment in this practice is more like becoming a member of a total wellness family.  The atmosphere is welcoming and comfortable. The expertise and professionalism are excellent. They are thorough and genuinely care about your wellbeing.  I am the one of 5 members of our family to come under their care and highly recommend them to anyone who is in need. Our family ranges in age from  birth to 56 and we all love them!

I have worked with them through critical care, transition care and am currently in lifestyle maintenance. I feel so much better physically! I also feel far more equipped to take better care of myself for the long run. Come join us!<//text>

Dr.s Melendez are hands down the best! A crew of magical elves merrily tinkering away on stiff bodies, they are always cheerful, thorough, and caring. The most fantastic chiro I have ever received! They gave me my life back after a car accident 2 yrs ago. A great family place with lovely ocean views, friendly prices, and pleasant music too. Highly recommend!!!</text>

Love Gold Coast Chiropractic! After every visit I leave refreshed. They work hard at what they do and you can tell they care about you. Even amongst COVID, they continue to work hard, serve you, and take care of your needs while following all the guidelines put out by the CDC. As a former football player (10 years of playing) I am thankful for all the healing that has come from seeing Dr. Dave and Dr. Jacob. They are helping me heal and feel healthy again!< /text>

I was so happy with my first appointment that I brought my husband in the following week. I have been working with Dr. Lorraine and my husband is not working with Dr. Dave. They even have a play room for kids to stay in while their parents are getting their treatment. Beautiful pictures of their clients all over.. some of the best equipment I‚Äôve ever worked with.
I am so happy to have found them and every single person in that office has been amazing!
Thank you Gold Coast!!!!</Text>< pictures>

I really enjoy going to Dr. Lorraine for adjustments.  She has a great touch and employs some unique techniques and modalities that I haven't experienced with other chiropractors.  I especially appreciate how each of the Drs. Melendez has his or her own little specialty, so chances are you'll get to know each of the doctors!  Every staff member at Gold Coast Chiropractic is not just friendly, but genuinely cares for your long-term health.< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Gold Coast is as good as it gets.  From the moment I walked in for my first visit, it has been such a smooth and rewarding process.  They treat you like family.  Each doctor gets to know you and truly cares about how you are doing on the journey back to health.  Your body was made to be healthy, but sometimes we need a little help to get back to health.  Dr. Dave Melendez has given me that help that my neck and back needed to feel normal again.  I am 39 and have had chronic neck stiffness and pain since I was 19.  For the first time in 20 years, I feel close to normal again.  They have an amazing philosophy that includes a great warm-up, excellent adjustments, and a rejuvenating post adjustment process as well.  They include home care advice as well.   I cannot say enough about the Melendez family and my experience at Gold Coast.  Amazing people who are at the top of their game.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Gold Coast Chiropractic has a great system for correcting the root cause of what ails you.  Not just a quick fix establishment.  I‚Äôve been seeing chiropractors since I was 12 so 40 years now and I‚Äôve seen it all with chiropractic and Gold Coast is like none I‚Äôve ever been to as far as their approach.  Dr. Anna took a before x-ray of my back, placed me on their unique SRT table then performed some light adjustments.  The after X-ray show‚Äôd my spine already correcting after one visit.   They have other machines and methods I have never seen before.  Super progressive place!  Each visit in a series brings you to a corrected state with long term benefits not just a temporary fix.  That‚Äôs what differentiates them from other back-crackers.  I‚Äôm so happy to have had this experience with them!  Highly recommend Dr. Anna at Gold Coast!<//Text>< pics>

If you‚Äôre looking for a family run local Chiropracter office that gives excellent care then Gold Coast Chiro is the place for you! I have been working with Dr Anna for the past few months and she is fantastic. She is gentle, knowledgeable and always explains what she is doing, which is great for someone like myself who was nervous of getting adjusted! My migraines have significantly improved since seeing Dr Anna and I would highly recommend her!< /text>

I didn't grow up with chiropractic care, so I was a little nervous going in for the first time. During my first visit a few months ago, Dr. Anna did an amazing job explaining every step from the initial consult through first appointment. She made sure I was comfortable and understood the benefits based on my specific needs and the science behind chiropractic before my first adjustment. The office is convenient to get to (both off the highway and within Encinitas), and you get the benefit of supporting a family-owned local business. Highly recommend Dr. Anna :)<//text>

<Review>The Melendez family doctors are out of this world great! They are extremely personable and always positive. I like the fact that they suggest exercises and nutrition as part of the treatment. I have been to various chiropractors in my life and Dr. Melendez and family at Gold Coast Chiropractic are by far the best! I come all the way from Tijuana to get treatment.<//Review>< username>

I have been going to Gold Coast Chiropractic for a few years now. All the Dr.'s Melendez are so knowledgable and really take the time to sit down with you and help meet your health and chiropractic needs. Have nothing but the best to say about their practice. The office is located in Cardiff a quick drive off the freeway right off Highway 1. Very relaxing office environment when you're there and the entire staff is so helpful, friendly and inviting. Would definitely recommend them.< /text>

Dr. Anna and her team have made a new experience an easy adjustment (pun unintended). I am in my second pregnancy and going to a chiropractor this time around has lessened so much of the discomfort. It doesn't matter how small the discomfort may be, Dr. Anna listens patiently and you feel heard as she asks you more pointed questions and how you may be feeling in other areas as well. After a handful of visits, we opted to have my two year old be evaluated as well. After one visit, he is sleeping better and his digestive issues (what we were concerned about) have been clearing. Thankful that the team of doctors here help you create a plan so that way you don't feel like you are in a sinkhole of visits (even though I now look forward to every adjustment). They genuinely want the best for the patients and seek to help anyway they can. Thank you, Gold Coast Chiropractics!<//Review>

<review>I have been a patient of Dr. Melendez for over a year. I have been treated by chiropractors my whole life for various issues like headaches, sports injuries, and ‚Äúperformance tuning.‚Äù  I have probably seen at least 25 different chiropractors over the years. Based on my experience, I can honestly say that Gold Coast is the best. They have many chiropractors on staff that work together as a team (and family). You can‚Äôt go wrong with Gold Coast.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Time>1560379212105< /Time><rate>5</rate><Text>I recently went to Gold Coast Chiropractic Center. My experience at gold coast was 5 star from start to finish. The office is very modern and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. They even showed me a video on Chiropractic before they took me back for my appointment.

I saw Dr. Jacob. He was excellent and very knowledgeable. He took the time to answer all of my questions and explained everything to me. He was very thorough. I have never had a chiropractic adjustment so I was a little nervous. Dr. Jacob however explained to me exactly what he was going to do and what it was going to feel like before he did anything.

I loved my experience here and I will only be coming to them from now on. I strongly recommend anyone and everyone to give them a shot.

Dr David, Dr Lorraine and the entire family and staff are simply the best! My family and I have been coming here for over 15 years. When I was in a car accident, he's the first doctor I went to before even trying physical therapy or any sort of medications or visiting an orthopedist. I am very active with running and Dr Melendez has taken me in a short time from being almost debilitated by this accident to back up and running 15-20 miles a week. Gold Coast is a god send and I genuinely look forward to each visit! Thank you all üôèüèº</Text>

I have been to a lot of different Chiropractors over the years but never any that even come close to the Melendez Doctors. I drive about an hour + each direction because they take the time to listen ,exam, educate me and give me so much relief. They are the only Doctors I trusted with my babies and my grandbabies. What a difference they have made in my family's lives. Now if I could get them to open another office in Temecula üòâ</text>

Dr Jacob and the family are amazing. With a view of the ocean and the customer service it‚Äôs easy to give them 5 stars, not to mention their focus on long term spinal correction and not just a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù mentality. They treat you like you‚Äôre part of the family and the practice is run like a well oiled machine. It‚Äôs no surprise they‚Äôve been in business for almost 30yrs. Thanks Gold Coast!</Text>

It's a family business and that benefits patients because they'll call over one of the other doctors to help if needed for a specific adjustment. The atmosphere is friendly, professional and they have handled the COVID situation very well.
I can't recommend them enough.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

The team of Doctors here is awesome.  Dr. Loraine started working on my neck and back 4 months ago and the results are amazing.  She has been able to take my neck and back which was as stiff as a piece of bent rebar and get it all moving again.  She also has straightened it out getting rid of a bulging disc.  If you want to go to the best Doctors in North San Diego County you have to go to Gold Coast Chiropractic Center.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I see Dr. Jacob regularly because I get back pain from being at my desk a lot. So, I go in regularly and Dr. Jacob straightens me out and alleviates the pain.  Occasionally, I have ribs that pop out of place too, and Dr. Jacob is VERY good at putting ribs back into place. Visit by visit, he is adjusting me and showing me simple exercises to strengthen my weak spots. I can see a difference my posture, and I'm having fewer back issues as time goes by. Don't be worried if Dr. Jacob can't fit you in, because all the doctors are great, and they fill in for each other when needed.

The whole office is upbeat. I look forward to my appointments, and I always leave with a spring in my step, feeling empowered about my health.< /Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Jacob and the Gold Coast team are GOLDEN! I have the pleasure of knowing Dr. Jacob and his family personally. They all share a common goal of overall wellbeing of their clients through combined chiropractic knowledge from generations (third generation and counting), warmth and compassion. I feel these qualities run in their blood and is so evident in their genuine & honest care for their clients. They have not only given back to their local community, but also performed free care in many countries helping thousands of people live pain free and quality lives. I highly recommend Dr. Jacob and the Gold Coast team!<//text>

<text>I love Gold Coast Chiropractic! Majority of the time I see Dr. Dave but have received care from the other doctors as well and everyone is amazing. From the staff up front to the treatment room in the back it is always all smiles in the office. I really feel like I matter as a patient. When I first started going to Gold Coast 3+ years ago I could hardly move my head to the right and was suffering from frequent migraines. I am happy to say I have full range of motion in my neck again and I can‚Äôt remember the last migraine I had. Investing in care at Gold Coast had been one of the best choices I have made for myself!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dc0c1c5a97e635:0x35d665744880eba2< /GmapID></record>

< review>
I will write a more thorough review in the future with more details but the short version is I had an injury of protruding discs impacting my nerves in my spine. I couldn‚Äôt walk and was on heavy opiates and bedridden for about a month. I credit Dr. Jacob and Dr. Dave and Marcus and the whole friendly professional team at Gold Coast with helping me lower my pain and walk again. Their work on me plus my physical therapy got me up off the bed and walking in a about 6 weeks from
My first visit. I went from excruciating pain to feeling very close to normal a lot quicker than I expected and quicker than my prognosis indicated when I first injured myself. The thoroughness of having the x-rays plus Jacobs ability to explain my MRI‚Äôs and reports from Scripps were extremely helpful. The Dr that took my MRI at the hospital barely explained what was causing my pain and suffering and the team at Gold Coast were able to shed light and explain my entire spine from looking at my MRI‚Äôs, the MRI reports and of course the xrays they took. The best and most thorough explanations I have ever experienced with a doctor in my life. I just wish I was as informed when I was in my 20‚Äôs as I am now from their educating me on my own body. If I had gone to them sooner I could have saved myself a lot of pain and suffering.  With their help I hope to be 100% and learning to surf after 3-6 more months of treatment and sticking to my physical therapy.  They have helped me on so many levels and my whole family is now taking up all of their time getting their amazing thorough treatment.  I am very grateful. I Highly highly recommend seeing them especially if you can go to see what your spine is up to before you get injured.  But of course I think they were instrumental in helping me heal from
My injury faster than anyone expected.<//review>

Dave and crew at Gold Coast Chiropractic are amazing.  Dave helped my husband so much with his back.  He was unable to play golf without pain and now after a few months of working with Dave he can!  And any time I have pain from lugging around our 30 pound ‚Äòtoddler‚Äô I go see Dave and feel better so quickly.  I can‚Äôt say enough about the results but more or as important is how I feel so at home at their office. Every single person is so welcoming and positive.  Highly recommend Gold Coast!< /Text>

<Review>I had been to several chiropractors in Orange County prior to moving down to San Diego. I can confidently state that no other practices go as in depth with their treatment as the Melendez family at Gold Coast. They start with the x-rays to show you exactly what needs to be corrected as opposed to just stating some made up issues to get more business. They are all AWESOME and so welcoming to their client family!</Review></record></dataset><record>

A great chiropractor husband & wife team who are passionate about what they do.  They really take the time to listen and target the area in pain.  I can feel confident when I refer potential family/friends to them.  Their office is also in a great location in Cardiff right across the street from Seaside Market, easy to access & the view's not too bad either.</Text>

<review>I have been seeing Dr. David and Lorraine Melendez for over 16 years now. They have helped me and my family with so many issues to date. Since becoming a regular patient of theirs, I have been free from "IBS" (diagnosed and determined un-treatable by doctors), migraines (a neurologist could not come up with the reason I was experiencing these) and pregnancy aches and pains. Just to name a few. They have also changed the lives of my children, who have been adjusted since they were 1 day old. The Doctors' Melendez have helped my babies with spitting up, constipation and digestive issues. I would have very fussy babies if it weren't for the love and care of these Doctors. I am eternally grateful and a patient of Chiropractic for life.<//review>< user>

Could not be more thankful to have found this office. They entire family is conservative in their approach and reassuring, all while being warm and inviting.  Since starting to see them, ny migraines are gone and I rarely have to take any pain medicine. I was also recently badly rear ended and truly believe that without this office, my quality of life would be horrible. They saved me from injections and pain meds. I could not be more thankful to have found this family and could not recommend them more. I‚Äôm confident I‚Äôll never see a different chiropractor.<//text>

I've been a client of David and Lorraine Melendez for over 20 years and am consistently amazed by the effectiveness of the treatments.  I've been treated by others as I've lived in different parts of the US.  David and Lorraine stand out, not only because of their skills but also because of their character and genuine compassion.  I drive down from Vista to see them to manage a disc problem that I suspect would be much worse without their care.  I am thankful to God for them.</Review>

Well, not sure why it‚Äôs says i‚Äôm Jake, I‚Äôm his Mom. I‚Äôve been a patient of Dr. Dave for a long time. I‚Äôm a hard case, as I have a lot going on. Dr. Dave always makes me feel better, listens to my whines and always tries to get me to cut  out inflammatory food, lol. Honestly he‚Äôs a great chiropractor! When he‚Äôs not there I see one of the other doctors and have always been happy. I love he family atmosphere and that they love he Lord and give him he glory! Great Job Melendez family üòÅ< /text>

Dr. Dave and Lorraine are top-notch!  They are passionate about their profession and it shows in their treatment.  Their system is proven and simple.  Warm up for 5 minutes on the wobble chair, get adjusted by the doc, and then strengthen your spine on the vibration plate!  I have been a patient for 2 years and enjoy not only the physical healing that takes place at Gold Coast, but the spiritual healing as well.  I am now a RAVING FAN!!!< /Review>

<Text>"Amazing" only mildly describes Drs. David and Lorraine and their staff. They sincerely care about you, not just as a patient, but as a person. They take the time to listen and really provide the treatment that will help you towards healing and general wellness. My husband and I have been seeing them on and off for about 5-6 years or so, and now our infant son gets adjusted whenever we go in for our own treatment. I love this husband and wife team; if anyone I know ever expresses a need for a chiropractor (or even if they don't express a need), I always refer David and Lorraine!<//Text>< Pics>

I've been to a few different chiropractic offices in the past and I'm so pleased to say that Gold Coast Chiropractic beats them all. Dr. Dave pays special attention to my spine and neck in a way that heals and prevents injuries. My lower back feels great and has been strong for the heavy lifting and physical activity I do. Their staff is also professional and friendly. Five stars out of five!</Text>

<review>After hearing many not so good things about the Chiropratic world, i was pretty skeptical.
I have been pretty impressed with the care that this husband and wife team take to insure that your moving in the right direction towards healing. I don't feel rushed no mater how busy, I feel like my questions concerns or general curiousness are addressed with great knowledge. I feel like my body is shifting and moving way better then before.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Traditional medicine treats symptoms, but never offers a real fix.  We accept this as part of getting "old".  That does not have to be the case!  Dr. Dave and Dr. Lorraine truly care about their patients!  I have had chronic hip pain for over a year, and after my first adjustment, I am now cortisone shot free!  I highly recommend you go in and see them.  You would be surprised to see how many issues are actually FIXED with chiropractic care!  From menstrual cycles, to migraines, they can help you!  They are a wealth of information that will help get you on the right path to healing.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>I have been seeing David and Lorraine on and off for years (mostly "off" because they help me so much). I'm not their best client because I don't always do what they recommend, BUT...I see them when the need arises, usually after I've done something either mildly or egregiously stupid. However, once I go in for treatment for about a week, they get me back in the saddle, which gives me the confidence to go out and do even MORE stupid things!

Great customer service from the person behind the counter. I had the grilled cheese sandwich and fries. Wonderful! Fairly priced for the area and very tasty. Would definitely recommend and will definietly go back. Beer, coffee and good food. Alot of fellow motorcyclist there today as well. Great place!< /Text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>Beautiful location, beautiful restaurant but the food was sub par and way overpriced waited almost 50min for 2 burgers and both were cold and completely raw in the center. That being said, their frys are the only reason they get 2 stars really thin and crispy but not burnt, perfect.<//review></record>

<text>Originally had the wrong review. Service here was pretty quick but did not seem very friendly. We had the chorizo burrito and the blt sandwich. The sandwich came with plenty of fries that were crispy and good. The burrito was okay and came with chips. You paid before you got your food and bus yourself afterwards. The atmosphere is nice. Be aware that they are closed on Monday and Tuesday and are only open until 230. The bathroom was clean which was is nice for public use.< /text>< GmapID>

Great, quaint space! Outdoor seating was the best part about this "roadhouse." Food was over priced for what it was but I'll attribute that to the location. Sandwiches were decent but our fries were cold - like sitting on our plate so long before they came out cold. Also, do not be in a rush but ready to pause and relax while here.<//text>

<Review>Welcome to Big Sur where we will overcharge you for everything. Food was average at best. Fries were greasy. $14 for a turkey BLT. $3 for an 8 oz bottle of diet coke.....really? After ordering food, couldn't find a table that hadn't been wiped off from last guests and had to do it ourselves. Bottom line - if you come to Big Sur enjoy the scenery but bring everything you need and buy nothing here. Overpriced everywhere you go.<//Review><user_name>Ryan Wagner</user_name>< pictures>

Cute restaurant in the heart of Big Sur. Surrounded by campgrounds and RV sites and cabins, it's the perfect way to start your day in nature. They offer housemade donuts and delicious avocado toast. There is indoor and outdoor seating, outdoor seating includes a few fire pits for an added "camping" feel.<//Review>

<review>Simple little roadside tavern serving up some surprisingly tasty classic Americana.  We had the chicken strips and roast turkey BLY.  They offer amazing shoestring fries that are super tasty and tossed with shallots and seasons and are MOST crispy.  The ambiance was amazing with a fireplace and great music, plenty of outdoor seating available, including creek side bar seats.  A warm and inviting gathering place to eat or just snack and relax.  I believe it is a co-op with a couple of the local overnights, because I witnessed a few guests charging items to their room.  Worth a stop if you are hungry and driving by!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNShN28NhmsNoq-xcESverbE2UFC3o0jamcWeqd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Beautiful patio with two fireplaces and another one inside.  The Brewery beer was delicious, with a hint of vanilla in the darkness. Hubs said his tacos were good. I had the Roadhouse burger, and for $16 I really expected a hand-pattied burger, but it was frozen. The fries though...I don't know what magic they perform on their French fries. I almost gave this four stars just for those fries (and the patio). You have to order inside at the counter (another fireplace inside), which I thought was pretty chincey, especially since there were only 3 other people there.< /Review>

<Text>Stopped off for lunch and was pleasantly surprised to find a refreshing selection of beer and lunch fare. Perfectly sized menu for a lunch stop, with nice selections for all tastes. The pork tacos were bangin and chicken tenders with accompanying fries were deliciously crisp. The cabin-style room was so cozy and welcoming; complete with comfortable couches and chairs... like sitting in a living room with a copper, wood-fire stove to warm up next to and big windows to bring the outside into the experience. Outside dining area is adorable with huge pines towering over for plenty of shade and perfect for an afternoon refreshment with different seating nooks. The host kept us accommodated with excellent service. I‚Äôd come back again and again.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Very nice fish and chips. The fries were exceptionally delicious.
The location is cute and cozy, with country music and lots of succulents.
For $20 there could've been more fish, though, so I'll have to pass on the 5 stars<//Text>< pictures>

Worst Service ever. The waitress is not serving anything all. I highly not recommend to stop here. The food is a joke. Overpriced for low quality small menus. Usually i don't rate a restaurant that bad, but in that case i have to warn others people stopping here. This restaurant should be closed or burned down.<//text>

<review>Very cool place.  Wasn't busy while the rest of Big Sur was packed with cars, bikes, and sightseers.  Chicken Tacos and Coffee were very tasty.  Sparkling clean inside and out.  Outdoor seating areas made it hard to get back in the car and continue on our way.  A little pricey but what do you expect in this area?< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808d8ff9b7940863:0x1ee8ceea7251bb7b< /gmap_id></record>

Cosy place, but too expensive for the little food you get. I understand that prices have to be higher if you are not close to big supermarketes and suppliers but this was too much in my eyes. Dish was very tasty however.<//review>

While the food tasted good, it was over priced and the attitude from the staff was atrocious. We were driving back north from Julia Pfeiffer SP, and I made my husband drive out of our way past Big Sur SP because this place caught my eye.  It was a snap decision and I did not read the reviews about the rude service. If I had, we would have just gone to one of the other restaurants along this stretch of highway 1.

The girl taking orders and then bringing the food out seemed highly bothered to be doing her job. She was rude and very abrupt with us. We had ordered a lemonade for my daughter, and after paying was told they don't have lemonade and the alternative offered was a very small bottle of apple juice (which was WAY over priced at $3.50). The apple juice, as over priced as it was, cost less than the lemonade I had already paid for and no effort was made to reconcile the difference or apologize that I did not get the product I paid for. I learned my lesson about tipping at the time of ordering instead of at the end of the meal. I would have never left anything close to the tip I gave had I paid at the end of my meal.< /text>

<text>Wonderful addition to the Big Sur scene. Lovely place. Small but smiling staff. Nice space, both indoors and out. "Mid century meets The woods." Competent food.

They we're only serving breafast and lunch when we were there, but it seems like happy hour and perhaps dinner might be on the horizon. 'Never hurts to ask.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Has a cozy atmosphere and nice little outisde patio with the fireplaces. However menu is small and very pricey for the portions of food that you get. The three tacos were small nothing really special about them for the price that you pay and the chicken strips are basic. They do come with fries that were good but at the same time its not worth the price you pay for the portions. I would give more stars but the place is expensive for a small portion plate.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Great food. Limited options. The staff were very rude. They said it's to close to closing time to serve us anything but burgers and to choose quick. "We want to go home." Not good since a dozen other places were near by. Probably wouldnt go back. Great atmosphere though.< /text>

Ended up at this perfectly quaint little place quite accidentally one night many years ago after a very long drive on Hwy 1.  Hungry, we were grateful to see they were still open.  Had a wonderful meal in a beautiful, rustic atmosphere.  Such a welcoming vibe.  I've often thought about this little place over the years, and if I'm ever back in California, I'll be sure to return to this lovely place.< /text>

Lovely view and design overall. Solid place to stop along the coast- snag a beer, sit on the deck and have a bite. Food is a bit over priced but consistent with the area. Fries were dope.< /text>

We arrived and the ambiance is very new, open and a back patio.

We sat inside and right away we were told food would be 30 min behind? I guess honest‚Ä¶
Our waiter was sincere but didn't go over the menu, it is limited a handful of items

Wish they would of had more choices in salads. I ordered the house salad and it had too much olive oil in the dressing. It was tasty but less is more considering the array of fresh salad mix.

I think they have been getting busy but are not equipped to handle the influx of business and were out of quite a few item on the menu.

We were the first seated and to order but somehow the last ones to receive our food? I guess they chef works out of order? Kind of annoying<//text>

<review>THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER  HAD. Notice how I didn't  say 'one of the best'. You truly need to go there to know what I mean. It's a sweet little homely place that is just that... homely. From how you are greeted in till the time u finally pay your bill, they make you feel so comfortable and not rushed for anything. They literally make you feel like you are at home. Polite and efficient. Great 'wine and dine' place. A simply MUST TRY place on my list of places in the world.<//review><Date>1431261934475</Date><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

This place has the most amazing food and super friendly service. The decor is modern and artful. The outside patio was really nice. Best lamb gryo I've ever tasted. Ever. Best gyro. Best. Ever.< /Review>

Cute little spot at our hotel. Order at the bar and have a seat. The mexican options were both very well done. The portion sizes are quite small, so order extra if you are hungry. Prices are a bit high for the portion size here.</Review>

A great place to stay. The rooms are modern with quirky features and it's so quiet at night you can sink into the comfy beds and sleep 8 hours straight. It's also perfectly located for exploring the area. Avoid the restaurant across the road.<//Review>

Wish I had taken his picture because his expression said it all. With a name like Roadhouse we were expecting BBQ/Bar fare, peanut shells on the floor and a very laid back atmosphere... NOT this place. We will not return. EVER. I have no tolerance for rudeness or snobbery.</Review>< user_name>

<Text>Food was okay. The turkey wrap was good but the fries tasted like they'd been done in old oil. Service was mediocre. You get your condiments from the "condiments station" and there is a water station and a silverware station. They did bring the food out to my table, but everything else was on me. Soda is served by the bottle (no free refills) and I paid $18+ for my lunch. Overall, disappointing.</Text><time>1517869900462< /time><Pics>None<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x808d8ff9b7940863:0x1ee8ceea7251bb7b<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Terrible service and overpriced food. Don't even think about ordering lunch 1 minute before 11:30am. The "server" wouldn't even take our lunch order at 11:29am because they "don't serve lunch until 11:30am." There was nobody else in the restaurant, but we were treated like the place was full. The server even told us that we should try the place across the street instead of eating there. I guess we weren't welcome there.</review>

A but overpriced but a generally inoffensive place with fairly nice service. The patio in the back is a really sweet little area with tons of Stellar‚Äôs Jays flying around :) has a slightly limited menu which may not make it ideal for vegetarians, but still works well if you‚Äôre okay eating a decent amount of carbs!</Review>

<text>We love the decore and atmosphere. The huevos rancheros (pictured) were fantastic, which is why we got them two days in a row. The homemade donuts were hit and miss, and the lack of honey as a sweetener is the reason for the less than perfect review.</text>< Pictures>

My wife and I stopped by after a hike in one of the parks in Big Sur. We really enjoyed the tacos, and the maple pecan donut that I had for dessert was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had.< /text>

Pricy, small portions Nd not so great quality of
The food. If you stay at glen oaks across the road you get a sad free breakfast consisted of only 1 donut per person and a watery coffee, if you ask for a second donut! They charge you extra!! We won't get back. Better food and service at the River inn< /review>

A cool looking place from the road but I would not go back!  A beautiful back patio with stunning views over the forest- could be a very lovely place but this is a place where you must serve yourself completely.  I initially sat on the front patio but there seemed no interest from inside to anyone on the patio know you had to order inside.  There were 3 people and there dog who arrived before me and when they went inside and di not come back out I realised I needed to go inside to seek service.   As soon as I walked in with my 2 well-behaved dogs I was greeted by a gentleman behind the counter who told me they welcomed dogs on the front and back patio but not inside.  I started to make my way to the back patio and he told me the only menu was on the chalkboard inside.  It was clear from his comment he wanted me on one of the patios with my dogs and when I asked if he had a menu I could take with me he said no - -fortunately a co-worker piped up and said it was OK for me to have the dogs whilst I ordered.  (Mind you this is a counter with no seating and the restaurant portion of the inside was not in the vicinity of the counter).

The back patio was beautiful and the food was decent.  The place advertises fresh ingredients but the avocado was the spreadable costco style.  The food was good otherwise and the view was good - I guess in spite of acting dog-friendly when I was first greeted this is really not a dog-friendly place (or at least not by this staff member) and on top of that - -I didn't even get a glass of water or offered a drink with my meal.

The decent breakfast and the great back patio view are the only reasons this review is not a 1 star.  This is the worst stop in my 3 years of vacationing in Carmel area with my dogs and I will never stop here again!!</Text>

(Translated by Google) Fedest atmosphere, music, fireplace and incredibly delicious furniture. Super tasteful good coffee with almond flour. Thin and crispy fries. Can definitely be recommended from here if you take a trip to Big Sur !!

(Original)
Fedest stemning, musik, pejs og utroligt l√¶kre m√∏bler. Super smagfuld god kaffe med mandelm√¶l. Tynde og spr√∏de pomfritter. Kan helt klart anbefales herfra hvis man tager et smut til Big Sur!!<//Review>

Great job jhon! You are an asset. ( He also up sell a pair of orthotics inserts )< /review>

I bought a Supreme hat from them. Brand new
When it arrived it came in a repackaged box and bag. No Supreme packaging.
So I called them asking if my hat was authentic or fake.
They said they don't know if its "real" or fake. I even asked for compensation for this trouble of not knowing if my hat is authentic or fake. They couldn't fulfill any compensation for the authenticity of this hat.
Next thing you know I call back a couple of days and my phone number is BLOCKED from them.
HAHA this store sells product they don't even know if it's REAL or FAKE.
Boy did I get screwed. Store Owner: David.... Please fix this... I know times are tough.</Text>

<review>I came here at my doctor's recommendation and  what a fantastic experience! The salesman observed my stride, wear in my current shoes, shape of my food and fit me in a great new pair of running shoes and insoles. He also explained the purpose of every item he recommended. These guys really care about your feet. Would highly recommend to anyone.<//review></record></dataset><record>

After hearing that The Holy Grail was open I went in today and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I had join their VIP program when I purchased some HOKA's online, and I'm really glad I did, the ability to try shoes, socks, and insoles for 90 days or return for instore credit is definitely a plus because you just don't know how new shoes will work walking around a store.< /text>

i walked in The Holy Grail and the first thing I noticed was that all the customers were being helped.  There was not one person standing around waiting for someone to help them.  As soon as I started thinking that, an employee came and asked if he could assist me.  I told him I was looking for a running shoe, but I wanted to pick out one that wouldn't hurt my feet as much as the nike's i had on.<//Review>

Best shoe store ever. I bring my mom in once a year from San Carlos. Its a no-brainer for athletic shoes to accommodate my bad knees and back. You have to hunt for attractive non-athletic shoes, but its worth it when you find them. Service is outstanding.<//review>

<Text>I have been buying my shoes with The Holy Grail online but have never purchased in store before. I went in on a Saturday and it was busy but I was greeted right away and didn't have to wait too long. I was helped by the staff who was absolutely great. She was patient, knowledgeable and very friendly. I will make it a point to go into the store when I'm ready for another pair of shoes and will request again. I got a great pair of shoes and custom in soles which are making a big difference in my running.< /Text><rate>5< /rate><Date>1583411236044< /Date>< UserId.>

Edit: came back a third time for my second exchange and was offered a full refund or exchange (along with excellent customer service from Eric). Still not 5/5 because of my prior bad experiences with two other customer service reps but at least happy with my experience today.<//Text>

Mark the owner not only checked my gait but also diagnosed my metatarsal joint problem better than the first two podiatrist's that I saw! It would have been a lot quicker and cheaper to go straight to him.</review>

I got an excellent pair of used sandals from here. Definitely one of a kind. They appear to be hand made using materials sourced from the middle east, possibly from the Nazarene area, but the fibers are either synthetic or from a plant that isn't around anymore. They don't look like much but it feels like I'm walking on clouds when I wear them. They also completely cured my planar fasciitis! The only weird thing is when I walk in the sand they leave two sets of footprints? Well, usually. When I'm having a particularly hard time there's just one. All my friends are constantly asking where they can get a pair of their own, but I can't seem to track down the manufacturer. Anyone know of a footwear company that marks their product INRI?

Also you should ask for the "Eternal Life Cocktail". It's pretty heavily watered down whatever it is, but it comes in the most beautiful goblet and I haven't gotten sick once since I drank it!

Highly recommend! This place has shoes worthy of the gods!< /review>

<review>Knowledgeable staff but somewhat pushy. Found it odd they have a section for geriatric shoes alongside the running shoes.

I can't believe the wonderful service  I received at this store. Mark, the owner, was passionate about making sure I had the best orthotics possible (and he customized the heck out of them) for my special-needs foot. An undiagnosed  Lisfranc injury has caused me 35 years of pain but these orthotics make my foot feel better already!  Thank you!!!!<//Review>

After about 50 miles worth of chances, I realized the new running shoes I had ordered online simply weren't cutting it.  My shins were hurting, my ankles felt wrong, my runner's high was there but my body ached after a long run; it was time to talk to a professional.</text>

FRAUD ALERT!!! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE SCAM ARTISTS

The Holy Grail shoe store of Los Angeles took an unauthorized payment from me on 5/21/2020 in the amount of $330 via Apple Cash payment and will not respond to phone calls, emails, or direct messages on Instagram in regards to this matter.

They have now blocked me on iMessage and IG - and I have a pretty good feeling that that my emails will not be getting responses.

I have just filed a police report with the LAPD, and I have also submitted a report of fraud online with the LA County Department of Public Social Services

I hope the $330 you stole was well worth it!< /review>

It's a shoe paradise. I love this store. You can find good deals.  The store is huge. There is plenty of parking. Rows and rows of shoes. How can you go wrong. Prices are pretty good and clearance racks.</Review>

< review>
I purchased shoes from your online site on Instagram, I totally thought it was legit because I see you have a storefront, business hours, a phone number etc. Seems like a complete scam to me though. I paid 180 dollars for a pair of Nike SB Dunk Low StrangeLove Skateboards. Thought it was a great deal, but I should have known better. As soon as I paid, I was blocked and they won't answer their phones. Here I am trying to support small business and I get taken advantage of by a bunch of pieces of garbage. Don't buy from this company, at least on Instagram because it's all a scam. they take your money, block you, won't answer calls and any comment you put on the Instagram site is deleted.

Such great knowledge, experience and customer service! I developed planters fasciitis from wearing poor fitting and unsupported shoes for so long. MJ helped me understand so many intricacies of the issue and helped me find a solution. I absolutely recommend On the Run. They know what they're doing.< /Text>

Do not buy from here !!!!!!

This place is a scam, they are insanely overpriced. All the sneakers here are insanely over-priced just please compare the prices of what you want to buy from here to goat or StockX. They both have way better prices. I bought a pair of Yeezy 350 citrin brand new for 360$ or something and later checked to see the online price brand new is like 228 on StockX or goat. On top of that, this place also gave me a used pair for the price of brand new I noticed fading on the sole immediately before even putting on. I also noticed that the stitching was falling apart. You can find way better stores and the prices are scams.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>This place sucks I order 2 shoes from this place and they haven't shipped it out. I call them and find out that 1 of the shoes I have is out of stock I said ok to cancel my order and I was going to reorder. Then the next day I reorder 2 more shoes brand new. They sent me a shipping number that was messed up and I pay for express shipping. when the shoes came in it was missing a lid on my jordan 4s. They have no communication with customers when you call them they tell you things that make you happy but when the product comes in it's all wrong. Don't order online website is full of mistakes and workers don't fix it. I didn't get what I paid for spent over 500 dollars.<//review>< user_name>

<Text>My husband and sons walked in, looked around for shoes and was never greeted by the guys who worked there.  They planned to spend a good amount for several pairs of shoes, but took their business elsewhere.  If you can't open your mouth and speak and playing on your phone and laptop is more important, this place doesn't deserve your money.  Very disappointed as this place had come highly recommended based on selection.  Professionalism is not apparent here.</Text>< date>

I was a little skeptical on buying sneakers from this place being I'm from NJ an there in LA, I got no answer when I called them,Reviews about them were hit or miss, I just went with the flow ordered my Ray Gun 72s an they came within 5Day's !!! (Today) they look brand new not a single Mark on em I would recommend if your looking for fresh kicks this is the place to go ! I will be buying all my sneakers from them from now on !<//text>

Great place to visit with family, loads of green spaces. Also great for walks in the evening. The community center itself is well maintained and great for meetings.<//Review>

Been going to this place since I was young. Very expansive, with lots of things to do. Many holidays are celebrated here, with great shows and performances. With the drought, the lack of flowing water hurts, but once the pond comes back, it'll be fantastic again!<//Text>

Lots of birds and bird poop. They have a nice grass field, baseball field, tennis courts, fountains. Usually the water, fountains are not on either due to it being summer or the drought. There is also a playground, and an outdoor theater for plays.

Nice location, next to De Anza College, the Oaks for food. Quiet place with benches as well.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Came here for cherry blossom festival. It was very well organized. Very nice and neat park. Plenty of space to play with kids, pets, throw a frisbee or have a picnic. Fountain had no water, but that's related to ongoing drought. Plenty of parking - there is dedicated parking, street parking as well as few large stores nearby.</review>< pics>

This is a nice and beautiful park; however, its pounds are empty for few years already what suppresses overall impress significantly.
They say, it was marvelous with blue and shiny pounds full of water.<//review>

Great place for family to hangout. Sometimes there are events in the park. Parking is limited but I usually park in De Anza College across the street. It costs $3.<//Review>

Not much parking, especially during any events. If you are looking to play pok√©mon go, there are usually tons of people playing with a number of lures set up. It's also a charmander nest.< /Review>

This is the second time I have locked my keys in the car and I just happened to get the same company and driver Alex to help me out. I have to say the service would really have to standout in order for me to leave tow company a review. Alex was really awesome both times arriving way before the anticipated dispatch estimate. Each time he called me right away and gave an update time estimate. I can‚Äôt tell how much I appreciate Loyal Towing and Alex when it comes to service and professionalism.<//text>

This tow service is so bad I had to write a review! Really disrespectful and nasty staff! Nobody was following covid regulations i saw 3 workers not wearing a mask when they talked to me! They scratched my car and charged me more than what we talked about over the phone! This place needs an audit! Nobody use this tow service!</review>

I called several companies for my motorcycle to be towed and they were the fastest to respond and gave me the lowest price. Everyone else was ridiculous and wanted to charge me way more and make me wait over an hour. These guys responded within 20 minutes. 5 stars and really want to thank the driver memo for helping me out!<//Review>

Loyal Towing is one of those businesses that you can't help but leave a review on. When I tell you that this towing company is beyond incredible, please believe me. My car broke down and I needed to have it towed to the shop for repairs. I called Loyal Towing around 11:30pm and schedule an early morning pickup for the next morning. Price was way lower than other places I had called... by a lot. Troy, my tow truck driver was phenomenal. He had my car hooked up in less than 5 minutes and we were on our way. Troy was courteous, professional, and prompt. I've been telling all my friends and family that if they need a tow to contact Loyal Towing. I most definitely will if I need another tow. They deserve 10 stars for the wonderful service I received.<//text>

<text>I was rear ended on the freeway and the CHP had my car towed to Loyal Towing. The accident report showed the time of 3:30 pm and I got the car out at 10:21 am next morning. They charged me a total of $360. $230 for towing and two days of storage of $65 each day. The distance from the accident site to tow yard is less the 10 miles. It's totally ridiculous charging so much. Also the customer service in my opinion deserves  zero star.<//text>< pics>

Yesterday on the 94 west bound my car was struck and became disabled on the 15 southbound  ramp. Fortunately there was a tow truck just passing by that pulled over and assisted both vehicles. The driver, was extremely helpful, he was professional, courteous, and went above and beyond expectations. Great company.< /text>

<Review>Thanks Mark, you were awesome yesterday, your professional demeanor was just what was needed during the streeful situation.  Keep doing a superb job.  Your service was just the opposite of what I experienced in my initial attemp to use USA Towing!  They are such a disappointment when it comes to ethics in the San Diego community.  Loyal Towing to the rescue!  Thanks again Mark!  Now go get some ice cream!< /Review>< Rate>

Was waiting with a friend and we waited over 3 hours to arrive. When I called, I was told he showed up, did not see us, and left! It was hot, my friend is hadicapped and a weekend. Missed the rental car agency for tardiness. Took TOO long to arrive!</Review>

<Text>I have AllState roadside insurance and they contract with loyal towing , I have had them for 3 years and I love them, any type of emergency they‚Äôre always there. I‚Äôve met almost every driver and they‚Äôre all knowledgeable about what they do. They all go behind 110% customer service. I‚Äôve had no issues with there service. I would like recommend Chris at loyal towing for always taking care of my cars and one of best drivers I‚Äôve met for this company. If I could choose to use him every time I would !

I recommend to use them every time and must understand  they‚Äôre extremely busy and it does take a while for them to get to you but that‚Äôs part of the and please take that into consideration for them.<//Text>< Pictures>

Dorthy is wonderful! She went above and beyond in helping me deal with the insurance company. Chris, the driver, responded to the call extremely quickly and was very friendly. They will be my first call for any future towing needs.< /Review>

Was just on the side of the expressway with a flat and a gentleman, literally came to my rescue and helped me out. Never what i expected. Will be sure to let everyone know how nice, considerate and caring they are.
Thanks again for the help. I didn't want to be stuck in the rain or wait on hold any longer with my insurance company< /review>

Unfortunately, I required the services of this tow company twice in one month. FORTUNATELY, I had the nicest drivers, Ulysses and Eddie (in San Diego)! They were both so nice, quick, skilled and serviceable! Great employees and I hope their employer knows how awesome they are!! Thanks guys!
P.S. Eddie, did you give Ulysses his half? :)< /review>

Possibly the **worst** towing company in San Diego, California! They don‚Äôt even deserve the 1 star. After a lengthy and unnecessarily long questions, we were told to wait an hour for them to arrive. Furthermore, we were told that we were going to get a confirmation email‚Äî we never did! After an hour, they called us back and said that they got the wrong number and that we need to wait an hour more! AN HOUR MORE ‚Äî in addition to the hour we waited right in front of our car! We canceled and called another company.

<text>I wish I could write a good review for this company. In fact, I actually did write an excellent review back in July AFTER one of their drivers caused damage to my car and AFTER they agreed to work with my insurance company to take care of the damages. But now I find out that they are refusing to reimburse my insurance company so now an attorney is being hired. I thoroughly appreciated Alex's help during an awful day and I was even understanding when the way he loaded my car onto the truck caused significant damage. I know these things happen. I still appreciate Alex, but I am very disappointed in a company who cannot take ownership of mistakes and fulfill agreements to take care of those damages. This is bad, bad business Loyal Towing. I will warn as many people as I can to not hire you. I am saddened at your lack of integrity. Lisa Love< /text>< GmapID>

HORRIBLE customer service.  Bait and switch. They don't do what they say they will do and think they are the only tow company in San Diego. It just proves the great reviews can be deceiving especially if they have been solicited.<//Text>

They did not honor their arrival time and notified me 10 minutes prior to the arrival time they would be another 30 minutes.

My tow truck driver, Eddie, showed up 10 minutes early and did the job perfect. The price was more than reasonable and he showed exceptional customer service.</Text>

< review>
Just contacted Loyal Towing out of Vancouver Washington and was phoned by the driver who was going to pick up my vehicle. The driver who was unfamiliar with where my vehicle was, decided to cuss me out and tell me to F%%K OFF over the phone after I asked him If he had the correct address. This is by far the worst service by a tow company that I've ever received In my lifetime. I currently am an Operations Manager for a very large and nationally known automotive repair company and I work with many tow companies on a daily business. Loyal Towing will be a company that not only my business's never use again, but everyone I know In the Portland/Vancouver metro area's that work In the Automotive Industry. I know a lot of service centers and a lot of companies that use towing, and believe me Loyal Tow company just made a very large mistake.<//review>

Well it has been some six and one half hours and I have not hide not hair of anyone from loyal towing. Which means I still do not have my vehicle. Initially, I was told sixty minutes. Now six hours later. Nothing at all except a phone number which automatically hangs up without saying a word.<//text>

<review>My friend asked for a flat bed to pickup her car. Cost was 100$ they showed up with a regular truck to pickup from the front. It sucked cause they still charged 100$. It wasn't necessary to have the flatbed but when you're expecting something, and receive something less, for the same price, it's not good customer service.  The driver was nice .< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Chris was great he showed up within 20 minutes of me calling. I was in a very difficult moment Chris made it very easy and stress-free.
My truck had gotten a flat tire while driving on the freeway. I was in the fast lane while driving during the night, and the car in front of me swerved out of the way of a chair that was lying in the middle of the fast lane and hit his brakes.
I had to Swerve or Vere towards the right onto the chair to avoid crashing into the vehicle in front of me which popped my driver side front Tire.
I appreciate the fact that Chris actually cared about helping it was an amazing experience.

This will definitely be my go-to tow company in San Diego.

Pros-
√óChris is the absolute expert
√óQuick response
√óGreat customer service
√óAwesome experience took great care of the vehicle while loading it onto the flatbed.

Cons-
None

Thanks for the tow

<Review>The place is a dump - But it's a tow yard by the barrio, so...
As far as service, they were open at 1am which was nice. it meant my motorcycle didn't have to sit all night and rack up fees while I slept. The guy that helped me out was chill (drinking monster at 1am in the morning :D)
No one likes being towed, but as far as this experience went it was low stress. FYI if you wanna catch a hidden gem at this place, look up when you get in the garage. There is a balloon that floated to the top and popped on the roof, but caught a wire on its way down and is now hanging from the ceiling. Think of me when you see it :)</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80d9530e384efa53:0xe405bd5d5e61e5c1<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I want to start off by mentioning I have never provided a review on an establishment before; however, after my experience at Blue Granite today, I felt compelled to do so.

My two sons ages 8 and 12 have shown a recent interest in learning to climb. I took them to Blue Granite on a Saturday at around 10am and was immediately greeted by a very professional young man (Ivan) at the front desk.

Ivan welcomed my family and I and squared my boys away with some climbing shoes and harnesses. We were provided a tour of the beautiful facility and given a very thorough introduction to safety and climbing.

It was not long and my boys were literally climbing all over the walls in the gym.

The facility was exceptionally clean and the other patrons were friendly and helpful to my boys.

Our day pass afforded us the opportunity to leave for a few hours and return at our leisure. We left for lunch and visited family in West Shore then returned the same evening for more climbing as the boys couldn't get enough!

We live in Pollock Pines and will definitely be back to attend more classes to better our knowledge in safe climbing practices with hopes to take this outdoors during the spring and summer months.

Thank you to Ivan and the Blue Granite team for such a memorable experience.</Text>< pictures>

My previous residence in Paradise CA had no indoor climbing for 100 miles. This has helped me reignite my passion with rock climbing.

A minor addition i wanted to add is that they no longer have a coffee bar, but i never got coffee there and i dont think many members did. Still remains a 5/5 climbing gym for all of its other awesome features.< /review>< Pics>

SHAME on you, Blue Granite. I called ready to pay for the discounted 30-day membership at $55 today in order to exercise before my full-time job due to the smoke, and not only was I treated extremely poorly by your very inept and incompetent ‚Äúfront desk manager,‚Äù Henry, I was also told I couldn‚Äôt pro-rate 10 of my 30 days due to the fact that I would be flying out of state for 10 days in that bracket. I wasn‚Äôt even ASKING for a discount, just some calendar  flexibility. Sorry not sorry, but in the world of small local community businesses, you should be more flexible to the needs of your established local residents.

Reprehensible way to treat your community members, I will be taking my business elsewhere.</review>

<Time>1624896774406</Time><Text>OMG!!!! I LOVE MY MATTRESS!!! üíò MY WHOLE NEW BED. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT US A GOOD MATTRESS. MY HUSBAND AND I, HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH OUR BACK FOR A WHILE  AND COULDN'T AFFORD A NEW MATTRESS.  UNTIL ONE DAY I SAW THE AD ON FACEBOOK ABOUT SOME MATTRESSES ON SALE WITH ONLY $50 DOWN AND THE REST IN PAYMENTS. I CALLED AND I WAS SCHEDULED FOR AN APPOINTMENT FOR THAT SAME DAY. THE GUY IS VERY NICE, AND WILL HELP YOU OUT IN EVERY WAY HE CAN. ANYWAYS, WE DON'T HAVE AND NEVER HAD CREDIT, BECAUSE THEY KEEP REFUSING EVERYWHERE WE'VE APPLIED. IN REALITY, WE WERE ONLY GOING FOR THE CHEAPEST MATTRESS THEY HAD AND ENDED UP COMING OUT WITH THE BEST ONE BECAUSE WE WERE ACTUALLY APPROVED. NO MORE BACK PROBLEMS.!!! WOW!!! I AM BEYOND HAPPY. I TRULY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE. MY EXPERIENCE HERE AND WITH THE BUSINESS OWNER (TYLER) WAS THE BEST. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN  SO MANY YEARS, OUR BACK DOESN'T HURT ANYMORE. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE WE WERE APPROVED. I'M STILL SHOCKEDüò≤!! THANK YOU SO MUCH MATTRESS BY APPOINTMENT. üíï IT WAS A PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU TYLER.  THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP AND FOR YOUR GREAT PERSONALITY. THAT'S  ALSO WHY I GAVE IT A 5 STAR . HE IS VERY FRIENDLY AND THAT SAYS A LOT. SO IF YOU HAVE BACK PROBLEMS LIKE ME, AND CAN'T AFFORD A NEW AND GOOD MATTRESS, YOU SHOULD TRY THIS PLACE OUT. NO CREDIT NEEDED.  IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE. üòâüòäüëç<//Text></record></dataset><record>

made mattress shopping easy. Tyler was very professional and outgoing. Being a mom of 4 helped with time consumption and loaded things up for me himself to help with delivering cost. will definitely go back for future business< /text>

Looking for a bed can be super whelming. My experience here at Mattress by appointment was Aaaamazing Hassle-free and pleasant! We got really good deal and got our perfect mattress. Tyler was very helpful throughout the process never pushed a sale. He was super friendly! I recommend his Mattress by appointment , you‚Äôll find what you need and the buying process will be smooth and easy. Definitely recommending my family and friends here. üòÅü§ôüèΩ</Review>

<Review>I spoke with owner of Mattress by Appointment about needing a  mattress and he told me to let him know when I was ready to see them.  He followed up the next day and I was excited to be able to go in to see the mattresses when it was convenient for me. It was outside of the norm, because I didn‚Äôt have to go in and wait for help or have someone try to sell me on just anything . I went with no pressures and viewed the different mattresses and was given lots of expert information regarding the mattresses so I could decide what would best fit my needs. I was able to make an informed decision. It was easy! I walked out with 2 mattresses which I definitely needed and I am excited about getting another . Thank you Mattress by Appointment for catering to my shopping schedule and getting my home up and running!<//Review><user_id>108020490036191430547<//user_id><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1612077289604, 'text': 'Wow what a great, detailed review!

He didn't mind explaining the difference between each mattress even when my girls would ask him again and again lol. I got my girls brand new mattress for 50 percent off retail price! You seriously CANNOT beat that price. He delivered it to be and it was here by 630 pm even with his other deliveries so my girls could sleep in there new bed the same night. When you go other places you pay twice as much and usually pay WAY more than i did for delivery and don't get it for a few days!!! He has mattresses 50-80% off retail prices!!! Now that my girls room is done i will be redoing my bedroom and getting my cal king from him :)! Thank you Tyler! I appreciated it and so did my baby girls!!!

Tyler is a great dude! He's friendly and honest. Loved working with him!

There's a difference between 'being unconscious for a few hours every day' and 'sleeping'. You'll learn what the difference is with a mattress from MBA. Top quality mattresses, top quality service. 5/5 stars, definitely recommend!<//text>

Such a good honest family, super helpful, I had questions via social media because I have kids and didn‚Äôt want to travel all around just to look, they answered all my questions, they were very detailed, they never made me feel like I was bothering them or inconveniencing them. I will definitely be referring everyone I know here. Thank you Hodge family for meeting all my expectations</Review>

<review>The owner, Tyler, is amazing! He knows what he's talking about when it comes to mattresses, he loves what he does, and he has amazing customer service.

Finding Mattress By Appointment has become one of the best blessings in life.

My mattress has cured my depression, insomnia, and apeirophobia. I am now convinced that Heaven is just filled with mattresses from MBA, and Jesus himself has delayed his imminent return because he's sleeping on such a blessing of a mattress. I don't blame him. I haven't left my mattress in two days. You won't either. In fact, if everyone had a mattress from MBA, there would be no more Covid. No one would ever leave their homes again.

Do your best to stop the spread. Forget about staying 6 feet apart- Buy a mattress from Mattress By Appointment, for the good of yourself, and for the good of humanity.</review>< user_name>

<Review>I ordered a cal king frame that was box spring also  ...I thought what kind of frame comes in a box ... I didn't think it was what I wanted and for price I thought I got what I paid for ....I WAS WRONG !!! It's sturdy ...easy to put together ...and worth every penny !!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the frame box spring  and ooh yes plenty of storage space underneath ... I recommend buying from here ...5 stars from me< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I took in my Mustang 96 in for an alarm installation. The guys at the shop quickly showed me the products they sold, I was sold on the Viper alarm and asked if they could make it a bit sensitive. The job took about two hours plus change and the price was very fair. Thinking of taking my 86 to get a spoiler installed there as well.< /text>< name>

I did a van conversation and Joe's did the electrical upgrades and also the custom upholstery. I was very pleased either the end result. Bruce handled my account, and he was pleasantly to work with. I'd recommend them to my friends or family and will be back with my next project. All together excellent work.< /review>

<Review>I went to get my audio fixed since there was no sound coming out from my factory radio. I got a hold of joe and he told me it‚Äôll be $75 to do a diagnostic and see what the problem was. Within 10 minutes him and Bruce tell me that it‚Äôs coming from the speakers that I have concerning with the wiring and that I‚Äôll have to disconnect the speakers from my radio so I can have sound again. I tell them if they can disconnect them and they said they can‚Äôt since apparently it was an easy job and I could do it myself . I end up disconnecting the wiring and still there‚Äôs no sound . Then Bruce tells me it‚Äôs the perfect time to invest in a new radio unit and speakers. LOL WHAT ? Literally everything works but it‚Äôs only lacking sound so I doubt I need anything to be changed AND I still end up paying $75 for not even a diagnostic just them opening the trunk and telling me it‚Äôs a wiring problem when it wasn‚Äôt . Live and learn I guess. Don‚Äôt expect to get radio or audio repair from them and go to a trustworthy shop that actually works with audio</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I've come to Joe's stereo to have my front windows tinted five different times, for five different vehicles I've owned. They are the BEST in town. Today was my latest visit and for this visit Ahmad helped me with finding the right head unit for my Sierra. The install was to perfection. Upon leaving, I noticed that my remote for my alarm system wasn't working. I called Ahmad and explained the situation. He asked me to comeback so that he can take a look at it.  I brought it back and he had told me his guys had affixed the antenna back to my windshield because it was dangling. Which I appreciated. Well, the problem was, was that the antennas wires were so brittle, the wires were not making contact. This happened when they went out of there way to affix the antenna for me. Long story short, Ahmad personally stripped the wires back and repaired the wiring for me.  This guy is a straight up guy. Customer service is above and beyond. I will continue bringing my vehicles to this man. He's an honest straight up guy. I highly, highly, recommend this shop.< /Review>

<text>WORST BODY SHOP WITH NO DOUBT

I brought my 2015 Audi R8 to get my aftermarket exhaust installed. I asked them on Yelp. The estimated hours they told me was 4 hours at $90/hr rate which is $360.

Next day I received a call from the mechanic for 2 broken exhaust clips that needed to be ordered from Audi. They charged me $160 each which is $320 in total. I‚Äôm not sure if they broke the part and asked me to pay the money. The same day I went to Audi San Diego, asked for the price of the clip. It is $120 each. It‚Äôs not even the worst!!! I decided to trust them about the broken parts if they could finish the installation correctly.

A day later, they called me to pick up the car, I found that the whole rear bumper and taillights were mispositioned with HUGE gaps between each part when I got there. I tried to talk to the mechanic in order to find a solution, but he said, ‚Äúthe car was originally brought like that, I even fixed it‚Äù. Even if what he said were true, I couldn‚Äôt understand why a professional mechanic finished a job like a 2-year-old kid building a LEGO! Especially it‚Äôs a R8! Besides, he is the ruddiest mechanic I have ever met in my life. He constantly pushed the responsibility to me, kept saying, ‚Äúthe car was like that when you brought it‚Äù, couldn‚Äôt stand up like a man. I couldn‚Äôt drive my car back like that, so I asked them to redo the job.

When I went to pick up the car today, the gaps between parts were smaller, but the rear bumper is still a little bit sticking out. I don‚Äôt want to waste my time with them anymore, so I decided to drive back. Then they gave me a $1,300 bill, 6 hours labor fee for the first day installation (The work was totally unacceptable), $320 for 2 clips (while the price from Audi is $240) and 2 hours labor fee for redoing the job. When I was negotiating the price, they thought I just wanted to find their problems and avoid bills. The mechanic became very aggressive and smashed stack of 10-dollar cash on the counter. He yelled at me, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have money, I give you money‚Äù, which was hilarious to a person who drives a supercar.

My car is still not in shape and I will take it to dealer to do an inspection for safety reasons.<//text>< Time>

They saw me coming. Charged me over 500 to rewire my car alarm and I had to come back 4 times before they got it right. THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS</Review>

I went in to setup getting parts ordered for an installation, not only did they have everything but they were able to get it done in a couple hours.
Extremely clean work. They are excellent.< /Text>

< Review>
Decided to upgrade the stock sound system in my 2017 Jeep Wrangler unlimited and ended up going with Joe‚Äôs after getting a few quotes around town.

I love music and the stock radio and speaker system in the wrangler sucks. I wanted to go with someone who had experience working with the Jeep body style and unique roll bar set up.

After talking to a few shops, I met up with Ahmad at Joe‚Äôs and quickly realized that he was way more knowledgeable and professional than the other places I visited.

He actually talked me out of the more expensive sub woofer I originally wanted and built a custom box that fits perfectly in my trunk for two subs instead of the original overpriced one. I also had a new head unit, internal speakers, and equalizer installed and the end product looks factory seamless.

Plus...it sounds even better than it looks!

To say I am satisfied would be an understatement. I 100% recommend Ahmad and his team. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!

I‚Äôm just mad I didn‚Äôt come here sooner. I dropped off my car in the morning and was off driving into the sunset with my new system that same day. Thanks again Joe‚Äôs!<//Review>

These guys do good work and are very friendly. I had a amplifier installed in my car and the result is great. High quality work.

The reason this is not a 5 star rating is only due to pricing and how they quoted me. Now I realize labor and pricing when it comes to customization in a car can get expensive. But I was quoted and had to pay for the job before they had even looked at what needed to be done. The amp itself is not anything fancy, and cost around 170$ on amazon. The total sum of installing the amplifier was 700$. So I payed 530$ in labor which was PREDETERMINED before they had opened up my car.

In my experience with other shops, I have never had anyone quote me on a job before they opened up the car. And if this is a standard rate for just installing an amplifier then this is a VERY pricey shop.

When talking on the phone before taking my car in the hourly rate is 75$. From the time I left my vehicle there it took them 4 hours to call me and tell me I can pick it up.

At a 75$/hour = 300$ labor if they started working on it immediately. So where they got the sum of 540$ was just something he grabbed out of the air.

As a novice when it comes to car audio equipment, I feel like they did use this to their advantage when quoting me beforehand on this install.<//review>

I'd been putting off my broken car stereo for a while.  I came to the shop needing super quick service as I was taking a lunch break from work.

Something came up and my car stereo needed an additional part, and I was stressed because it was going to take longer than expected and I was not sure if I could come back for them to finish anytime soon as I was taking care of an ill family member and working crazy hours.

The owners Ahmad and his brother, as well as all the employees did an outstanding job in going the extra mile to get things done quickly and explain how everything works.   I rarely write reviews, but wanted to express my sincere gratitude for all the help and absolute top notch service that Joe's Stereo provided.</Text>

I got an alarm system and remote starter installed on my vehicle. I had a lot of questions prior to the install and I feel kinda like I burnt out the guy trying to help me, almost like he wasn't pro-actively explaining how the system worked on my car, so it forced me to just have to ask a lot of questions.  I decided to have the work done and it's definitely a little more of a quirky system than I had originally thought.  Over the phone, the way he explained the system made it sound a little more simple, but when I got everything installed, it ended up feeling like a lot more had to be explained that I had initially thought.  He went through everything briefly upon picking up the car, and things worked alright for a while.  After a while though, things started going a little wonky with my remote starter.  It would start the car and shut off after about 10 seconds.  This happened for a few months, but I had moved out of the area, so I couldn't really take it back there to be looked at.  Then after a little while longer, the remote starter, lock/unlock features seemed to not work at all.  I went to another security shop and they reprogrammed the remote and put new battery in as well.  This cleared up all the problems.  I understand many of my complaints are about the viper system I had installed, and it seemed like Joes Stereo did the job and did it right, but I just wasn't super impressed on the customer service with explaining everything and not making me have to fish for more answers.  It wasn't a terrible experience, but it could have been better.<//review>

I took my car to check the alarm because it keeped beeping every minute the place where they install it didn't do a good job, here in Joe's they have a good customer service they fix my alarm and didn't took a long time. They do a lot of thing like car alarms, stereo installation, window tinting. This is a great place and they have good prices üëçüëå</review>

Oustanding business all the way around! Had my stereo installed in 2011 and have had ZERO issues since then. Recently purchased a vehicle in Arizona and only trust them to get it done......roadtrip!!! Called them just now to see if I needed an appointment to get in and refreshingly they are still the same laid back down to earth business made plans with them over the phone. As long as they are in business i will be taking my vehicles to them< /Review>

Joe's Stereo is the best in the business! Tigran was such a great help. He sent some of his guys quickly to do all the measurements, we went through our options and my wife and I were presently surprised on how cheap everything was going to be for some great Milgard windows. We even thought we had an issue because our side fence post is right in front of one of the windows we were replacing. They were still able to do a great job and instal them all with no problems. They did not even have to cut our gate and remake it. I would recommend Joe's Stereo to anyone looking to replace windows or doors. Fast, easy and cheap all the way through. Thanks Joe's Stereo!<//Text>

They also redid my interior lights and exterior lights to LED‚Äôs. Now not the fuse but 5 out of 6 of my interior lights don‚Äôt work. Furthermore my headlights don‚Äôt work and my bed break light fell off.
I‚Äôm an electrician by trade and inspected the work myself and many corners were cut. I‚Äôll explain each as simple as I can.
First the headlights don‚Äôt work because the relay box under the hood was not protected. I had been rained on driving to Palm Springs and my headlights went out due to shorting out from water getting in to the box. This would not have been that big of a problem or issue except when I brought it up to a man named Ahmad. He insisted it was my fault and he needed to charge me for a replacement. After explaining to him I was an electrician he relented and replaced the box for free.
The other lights were simple fixes simple because just wires came ‚Äúundone!‚Äù Just imagine they also do major car repairs. What if they required your cars safety features.
Lastly the speakers. All this is, is a simple load calculation. The truck I have can handle the 2 subs and 4 speakers except when you are driving at night with headlights on and the AC going your fuses start popping and eventually the speakers stop working tell the voltage draw equals out.
All in all at first I was happy with the customer service and what I thought was the quality but now less then a year later with all these problems i would say these guys are fine but only with a through inspection by a professional you trust. I‚Äôm just not sure how to do that unless they are there to watch them.</text>< Pictures>

They made a custom box for my subwoofer and one of the technicians (Chris) did a phenomenal job of executing it.  It also helped that they all take pride in their work and went over the time they said they would have it done.  That wasn't a problem because Ahmad gave me a loaner vehicle so that I could continue my work week.  All this to say that I am highly impressed with their work and I will definitely use their services again very soon.  If you want good quality custom work on your vehicle Joe's is the place to go.< /Text>< pics>

Very fast and efficient, I would recommend to come here for all car needs. My speakers blew out in my car and I was quoted outrageous prices through the car dealership and best buy. These guys were very reasonable and had my car complete within 35-45 min and on top of that they fixed my front bumper (free) and really made me feel comfortable the whole time I was there. I will defiantly be going back. Fun, friendly and professional staff. Thanks again guys!< /review>

<Review>I called about installing a security system in my new car. The dealer wanted a huge amount of money for a basic system.Joe's quoted me a substantially lower price for a much better system. I went early, they took me in immediately and were very quick. They took the time to show me how my system works and answered my questions. I would definitely recommend and will use again, still need my windows tinted.<//Review><gmapID>0x80d95377f219043b:0x920ef9bbc9a02185<//gmapID><response>{'time': 1429469736074, 'text': 'It was a pleasure working with you ,we like to save our customers money along side of giving them the best service!'}</response></record></dataset><record>

I had windows tinting job here a week ago. They put 3-5 days of "do not roll the windows down" sticker on the switch. I had not rolled down but somehow a little stain like mark left on the driver's side. So I went back and told them just to let them know and they removed and put a new one for free. How great.</review>

I had them install a new stereo and window tint on my truck. During the process my passenger front seat was stained. I took care of it on my own due to how rude they were during the entire process. After almost 2 months my window tint still had bubbles and streaks in it, I called to see if they could do anything and was given every excuse on why it could be my fault. I didn't even roll down the windows for a week. I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are much better shops with better customer service. Save yourself a headache.</text>

<Review>Called Joe's stereo this morning to get a quote for a diagnosis on my HID setup because the previous owner made a complete mess of the wiring. They told me to bring it in and within 10 min they were able to tell me what was wrong and also pointed out that I had an exposed power wire which was very dangerous and a potential fire hazard. They gave me an incredible price on a full rewiring/ clean up of my HIDs as well as fixing my power wire. I had my car back the same day I dropped it off. The work was extremely clean and well done. All the employees were very professional and helpful. This shop does a wide variety of work from body, to mechanical to electrical and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to get work done to their car. I have a high performance car and am very particular with who does the work on it given all the modifications I have done and after my first experience with them I'd trust them for any work I might need done.This shop is the definition of a one-stop-shop. I will absolutely be returning for any future work I'll be needing.</Review><Date>1525393423607< /Date><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

I went in because I was attempting to install an after market radio and take out the factory one. I was stuck and couldn't figure out what to do next. I went in with the intention of paying them to finish it for me. The guy came out and looked at my progress and then told me that I could finish on my own. He showed me an adapter I was missing,  stripped the wires for me and then explained the rest to me. They could have easily saw that I was woman and taken my money to finish the job but instead encouraged and gave me all the confidence I needed to complete the job myself!!< /review>< Response>

<review>Rented a car for the last leg of my trip here in San Diego and on the last day, stereo lcd was broke by a heavy phone crashing into it, lol...

Ahmed and his crew, crushed it, meaning same day in and out and saved me apprx $2000.00 or more by replacing it right away and rental car company knew nothing!

If I EVER had to use a place like such again, THIS IS THE ONLY place I'd go again!

<Review>I've been a long time customer of Joe' stereos, since becoming a customer in 2005 the shop has work on several cars that I've own which, always without a hitch.  I've recommended this shop to many of my friends who've also gotten work done. One of the best if not the best shop in San Diego by far, I am and will always be a continued loyal customer of Joe's stereos.< /Review>< userid>

The best things come from the most humble places!   Joe's Stereo, led by Ahmad, will leave you smiling.  You will drive away stoked and you will realize that some of the best work comes out of San Diego locals.

I needed an upgrade for my Porsche 911.  I came away with a unit and service that rival any automotive shop in So Cal.  Ahmad stayed in contact with me, made sure I was happy, and continued to follow up with the work done.  I had to go back to Joe's for fine tuning and I came away more stoked than ever that I found these guys....

If you need automotive work, stereo's, alarms, modification, etc ... go to these guys.... Joe's Stereo ...........boom<//text>

<username>Eric Perkins</username><date>1489288243035<//date><rating>5<//rating><Review>Had my Land Rover LR4 sound proofed a month back. After installing a custom sub enclosure in the tailgate the whole back of my truck sounded like it was going to rattle apart. The staff has been great, easy to work with.

Chris did an amazing job, it took longer than expected but that was because he took his time to take care of every detail. Don't be fooled that it's just sound proofing it was an extensive job on a complicated vehicle that the whole back of needed to be disassembled.

I'm taking my truck back this week for another project, to remove the factory exhaust (2 mufflers and a resonator), and remount my trailer brake controller. I will update the review after it's done with pictures of the exhaust work and a video, along with the brake controller.<//Review>< Pics>

I went to pretty much every car audio shop in San Diego before coming to Joe's. At the other audio shops I either felt pressured or didn't have enough confidence in the rep to trust them with my vehicle.

I went with an Alpine 10" Type R sub woofer and the Alpine mrv500 amplifier. This is a solid set up so I could have bought it from anywhere, including cheaper online. But I got the equipment from Joe's as well because they are an authorized alpine dealer in San Diego. That means I can get the warranty through Joe's and not have to send it to Alpine and wait, if there ever is an issue.

When I first walked in the door I saw them working on a Lotus, good sign. Anybody entrusted with that beauty should be good enough for my measly 05 Mustang. But it was the people at Joe's that really sold me. Mr T and Ahmad were both helpful and answered all my questions. The work was done right, using quality wires and connectors. And it only took them 2 hours from start to finish.

Let me tell you the system hits and sounds clean thanks to their tuning. I highly recommend this place to anyone needing audio or other work done to their car.

I'll be coming back to have my rear lights blacked out.<//Text>

Came here to know how much would be an audio installation and one guy tells me a price for 4 door speakers and a amp for my sub, but when I return to get what they had told me I get a different price... They shouldn't be giving out quotes if they don't the actual price because it's misleading< /Review>

I went to the El Cajon store this morning with questions about installing a deck, ended up going down to the market street shop to have the install done immediately.  They knew I was short on time, and still took on the job.  The installers were professional and efficient.  Needless to say, any future stereo needs I'll be going straight there.  I'll probably be back pretty soon to have my windows tinted, just didn't have time today.  Thanks guys, keep up the great work!<//Review><username>Chris l</username></record></dataset><record>

The guys down at Joe's are always there to lend a hand. I've been there over 3 times in the past year and have always been treated like family. Ahmad and his staff go above and beyond to make sure that the customer comes first. Thank you all for being the best stereo & custom shop in SD!< /Text>

100% OUTSTANDING: Imagine the leader's top leader architecture in premier sound. AHMAD, stands behind his work, his employees have personable, and have professional workmanship. Listen up, Mr. T, Ahmad, and company are artists in every fashion. My car is showroom, one of a kind. I've had them do window tint, custom tail lights (painted) by the artists at the shop. These guys are custom "surgeons" for cars. Do you want  your car to be custom or one of a kind? Oh, hell yeah! I'm proud, my sound is loud, tight, clarity, and has been tuned by imagine "the owner" takes it to the next level. I won't go anywhere, period.

I have a side of me that is talented, sensitive, and creative. Imagine this? I had a date on a Friday night. They had a crew of  guys clean my car, tuned my sound for the night, fixed my air flow clean. This place is like family, they are talented, trustworthy, have sensitivity, loyalty, and have integrity to the fullest.

When I dropped off my car for the day. IMAGINE THIS: They offered to drive me home, offered me water, showed me places to eat. They give haircuts on Fridays! Custom everything to your pleasure. Stop by and say hi to these guys. To Ahmad, Mr. "T", and Ali, and the other artists who designed my car to be one of a kind.... Thank you for making making me feel at ease. I left with a smile, and after a while, I'd say, I'm never going back to anywhere else. These guys are architects for custom work, stereo surgeon to custom your premier sound, artists in the back to fix your car to your needs.

Be ready, these guys are always there to serve you like a KING! I'm coming back. This is a family owned business, not like a chain restaurant. They treat you right, offered me coffee, made sure in every aspect I was happy, and went the extra mile to make me a lifetime happy customer. I'm definitely giving your company 10 STARS!!< /Review>

<review>I brought my Honda Accord in to get a body kit and a few other things done... after receiving great customer service and a lot of ideas of what else I could do with my car, Ahmad had may car looking better then any other Honda Accord out there... Great work, Great customer service, great price. I recommend that anyone who is looking to get there Windows Tinted, Body Work, Stereo Install, or a new Car Alarm Stop by Joes Stereo and any of the people at the front desk will help you make your car Look and sound just the way you like it!

Thanks Joes Stereo<//review>< resp>

<Review>Joe's Stereo Review

Top notch shop!

Ahmad, Ali, and Bruce, and one more installer (drawing a blank on his name) took good care of me. I planned a detailed high end SQ audio upgrade with them that included 10 active channels, a DSP, and a several layers of sound deadening to cut down the road noise on my 2016 Civic. They were able too fulfill my very picky specifications that I wanted.

2 days before my installation appointment my car was involved in an accident. Good thing Joe's Stereo also does auto body work! They worked with my insurance (Geico) to repair front/back end damage, engine turbo damage, and match my stock paint perfectly.

In addition to my auto repair they also installed my planned audio upgrade. They installed 9 speakers, 1 subwoofer, 4 amps, 1 DSP, and many layers of sound deadening material that I brought in myself for them to install (CLD tiles, Closed Cell Foam, Mass Loaded Vinyl, and acoustic foam).

My car is running smooth and sounding awesome! I highly recommend giving this a shop a visit if you have any car upgrades in mind.<//Review>< Rating>

I recently purchased a Mercedes S550 and I didn't like the look,I was researching online for custom shop and I ran into Joe's Stereo,I called and was greated by a gentelman named Ahmad,he gave me an address and I drove over later on that day,hey gave me different Ideas and wheel and tire options ,which he has somekind of program to show me how my mercedes would look,Wow,three days later,let me tell you was looking sweet and very classy,the previous owner had black ghetto wheels and really dark tint which made my windows look almostpurple,Ahmad suggested I go with a lighter tint shade and silver concave wheels which look elegant will still on the conservative side,I am in the morgage industry so we have open house and what have you,so I don't want my clients to scared to get in my car,LOL ,overall these guys are amazing ,the job was done correctly and I am a happy camper,I'm waiting for my next deal to close and I am going back to Joe's Stereo for my ipod and bluetooth intergration piece,which is almost $650,Thank you Joe's Stereo,you guys are truelly one of the best custom shop i've ever been to.< /Text>

Today I went to Joe's stereo blindly and did not know what to expect. I was quick to be assisted in a proffesional manner and was helped through the entire process of replacing my head unit with an alpine CDE-113BT. the guys i talked to were well educated on the products and recomeneded me a quality head unit for a reasonable price. I was talked to with respect and treated kindly. The employees were honest and they engaged in conversation and taught me how to use my head unit properly. I will continue to send business to them.</Text>

<text>I just bought an Nissan Sentra and wanted a quality install of my Treo sub/amp set and I definitely came to the right place.

Just like all the reviews said, Ahmad took care of me and did a great job.  He told me what parts I needed and also gave me the choice of a level control (optional).  Turns out, my system slaps waaaay too hard on some songs (i.e. gucci mane/rick ross lol) so the level was MONEY.

Ahmad had a great attitude and made me feel right at home.  The guys in the garage definitely know what they're doing!  They did the cleanest possible install i could have imagined.</text>< Pics>

Taco are great but overpriced. Would recommend going on the day the tacos are on special for 99 cents. I love going on Friday's because their shrimp tacos are on sale!</Text>

<Time>1561170161727<//Time><review>It's usually hard to mess up Mexican food but with your name called Stand Up Tacos you would think that you have it going on. That is not the case. The menu selection is pretty good but what's sad is when you see a Alpastor cooker that is Empty. So sad. I ended up ordering a carnitas torta and I was really disappointed. The meat had NO flavor, the bread was sad and I could not even tell what kind of vegetables it had because it was very minimal. I understand that it's a business and they need to make money but even the fresh waters that they make is more water than fruit. Oh and be prepared to pay they $.50 card  surcharge. Not worth the cost to eat here, unless you don't like having flavor in your food.</review>< user_name>

<review>My brother and I walked in after seeing this restaurant on Youtube and Yelp.
I was really looking forward to trying a variety of street tacos. After standing there for several minutes, we finally walked out feeling frustrated. No one even bothered to greet us or acknowledge us. The cook as well as the waitress/server both just completely ignored us. I also noticed that several people were sitting at a few tables (none had food) and I was wearing my US Army shirt for Veteran's Weekend and can honestly say that I will never make the mistake of walking into a restaurant that has less than zero service. So sorry for you...<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>Visited on a Saturday, supposed to open at 11am, didn't open until 11:20am. Had the menudo, good flavor but no hominy, beef feet. That's the best part. After I finish asked the lady and she said that you need to ask for it. Torta was good but fairly small for the price. Would not go back since I wasn't impressed with their food.</Text>< pics>

The food taste good just the service was too slow.  It took almost 45 min to make 4 asada tacos and a burrito. This delay caused us to miss our movie.< /Text>

< Review>
Their Micheladas are great. The food is on par with the best. There is plenty of seating & awesome atmosphere being next to Edwards Theater. Most definitely recommend this restaurant to friends & family. **UPDATE** after coming here quiet a few times, I've noticed the customer service is not the best. Even without a line, for some reason or another the staff is always in their back kitchen, having us wait for them. Every Michelada Monday their miches are supposed to be on special & I always got charged the original price, each time having to bring it to their attention. To finish it off the big banner outside says they are open daily at 7am for breakfast. I show up just after 7 for some breakfast, the girl is just opening up & she tells me they are not open yet because the cook was not in yet. If management worked on the customer service this place would be as great as it has the potential to be. **UPDATE** This place is great, I'm glad management has listened to what the customer has to say & applied it to their business. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food & even better drinks. Their micheladas are in my opinion the best in town.<//Review>

<Review>Im sorry but i was really looking forward to going to this  place for a long time.. Facebook and IG have this place hyped up BUT its not all its made out to be

Service was ok, but the food was cold and very greasy and all we ordered were tacos, asked for guacamole and they gave us guac sauce.

The place needs to be kept up with.. Dinning room and restrooms were dirty, salt shakers were sticky just overall bad experience..even the trash cans looked like they hadnt been cleaned in months..

On a positive note.. The Beer was nice and cold!!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Ordered delivery, food arrived cold, but we reheated, ordered tacos, alpastor, chorizo,  buche and asada. We were missing the chorizo, no lemons, or salsa was sent. The buche was super salty, and there was an inconsistency in between the tacos some had 2 tortillas some had one. There was a silver lining if you are looking for asada tacos, those were the only good tacos they had. Overall not worth the money spent</text>

Disappointed with the Service Guadalupe your cashier gave us. She was Rude, dumb & with Attitude must be Family otherwise why else is she serving people. Honestly I would of fired her from my Restaurant with her bad Attitude. Food needs improvement I loved your Dancing Taco she's the reason we came in but Honestly we Will Never come back. Hire people that don't argue with your customers over 1 Horchata or what flavor we ordered or want.  IllI post my proof I had to show her it was 2 Horchata. *La unica razon que q entramos fue El Taco Bailarin pero con esa cajera q tienen van a perder clientes q no les importa Gastar.< /review>

<review>Online orders are practically never ready on time. They need to update the app to reflect accurate wait estimates. If I schedule food for 7 don‚Äôt make me wait til 7:30. If you can‚Äôt make meals fast enough don‚Äôt let me schedule the order for that time.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I have ordered many times online and they give me a estimated time that it will be ready. Every time it takes almost an hour past for it to be ready. They have a lot of other people waiting around for their food as well. Once you finally get the food it‚Äôs good. But it‚Äôs the long wait.</Review>

<review>Food has been consistently good. Unfortunately that's the only thing that is consistent. I go in and place orders regularly and I've found the online ordering had gotten progressively worse. It was pretty common for a item to be forgotten or incorrect. More recently the online ordering had been a mess. It seems like it's affecting most my local locations. I've waited over 20 minutes past my quoted time and witnessed many others experience the same more than once. If you go around dinner time you may see as much as 15 people standing around in disorganized confusion waiting for food the website says is ready for pickup. I don't feel it's the staffs fault. The system is broken and/or it being overloaded with orders and the restaurant doesn't seem to have a good method for managing the demand like others have had to implement during theses times with online ordering on the rise.<//review>< Gmap_id>

I was waiting in a large line for about 20 minutes I was a little irritated but I understood. But when the manager came out and told me to LEAVE THE LINE because they care more about the online orders more than they do the inside people. That just puts to show that I don‚Äôt matter and they don‚Äôt need me in there. But worst of all they said they were going to let us back in and I waited outside for another 15 minutes and went to ask the person standing outside guarding the door while they were struggling and he said they were not letting me back in. It makes no sense to me how kicking about 14 people is acceptable. I did not end up getting food and went to another place and so did everybody els who were visually irritated. This was just a Wednesday night I hope nobody has to experience this.< /Review>

<Review>I hate to write this because I truly love Chipotle so maybe it‚Äôs just this location. Time and time again we have issues here. Orders being wrong or food not up to the standards that Chipotle has. Today our guacamole that is fairly expensive to add was full of inedible chunks of avocado. Literally not even mashed at all. Half avocados that are rock hard. I understand it might not be the best season or some avocados aren‚Äôt ripe enough yet. But that‚Äôs something you should tell customers before they get guac and then and extra side of it. When I called and brought it up to the location they said, ‚Äúoh we know‚Äù which makes this even more disturbing. Guess I‚Äôll make the extra 10 minute drive to see if the next closest locations employees do a better job.</Review>< Pics>

Absolutely disorganized. They'll close in-person ordering and put a tiny sign up INSIDE the store but won't actually let you go inside the store, so you'll end up waiting 15-20 minutes outside in a group of people coming in/out for online and take-out orders. How are we to know that you're closed to in-person ordering if we can't go inside to read the sign that's inside? Put the sign OUTSIDE if you're closed for in-person ordering so that people aren't waiting in line outside for nothing? Or have your door-man outside telling people what and where to go.</Text>

This Chipotle is terrible! Twice now I have come to this location, ordered ahead of time and had to wait at least twenty minutes in the store to get my stone cold food. The people they have making the orders are not bringing them out fresh. For some reason they are making all the orders from a time block and then bringing out like 10 orders at a time. Why on Earth would they think that's okay? I don't want food that's been sitting for twenty minutes in a bag. This location has always had an issue, but it is only getting worse, rather than better. I won't be going back to this one.<//Text>

Their online quote times are off by at least 15 min. Quicker to go inside to order, which makes no sense.  Bad management.  Going to the Galleria one from now on
Update: tonight's order was promised at 6. Got it at 6:30. People who showed up after me and ordered at the store got their food 5-10 min
before i did. Pretty bad</review>

<text>Chipotle is our favorite place to order take out, but this location disappoints over and over again. Our pickup orders are almost always incorrect, and today they didn‚Äôt put any guacamole on my veggie bowl. That‚Äôs the majority of the cost of the bowl. I paid $8 for a bowl of rice and beans.

I went here and told me to wait for 10 mins for the steak and 10 mins have passed, I talk to the person at the counter and told me to wait for another 10 mins. I have been waiting. Im never coming back in this store. The fact that they told me to just step aside while i wait for the steak and didnt even bother to updatee how it's going with my order is so unprofessional.< /Review>

Very poorly run.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Used to love this place. Have loved chipotle for 10yrs. But last couple of times they messed up the order delivered at home. Were rude when went in to order. I am a strict vegetarian and recently turned vegan. And last time we got food delivered there was a piece of meat in my food. Which ended up in my mouth. I have never had meat in my life. This location has ruined it for me forever. Will not be having chipotle ever. I do not recommend this location</Text>

<review>I always get my burritos here, but today this guy named jaden would not serve me. He repeatedly said no when I asked him to heat up my tortilla a little longer, then proceeded to give me half portions. He and another member of the team started whispering amongst each other about me. he was very unprofessional and was shaking his head at me after someone else took over my burrito. Guy, if you don‚Äôt want to be there, find somewhere else to work. Then he continued to whisper under his breath god knows what. Chipotle has never made me felt more unwelcomed than at this location. I lost my appetite after this.< /review>< Date>

No point in online ordering at this location. So many doordashes and ppl in line I might've actually gotten my food quicker by not ordering online which is ridiculous. Keep in mind I ordered 30 mins in advance. When I got the bowl it felt abnormally light for literally any chipotle location, especially since I asked for extra rice and cheese. I opened it up and this must be the most anemic Chipotle bowl I've ever gotten from any location ever. I also added guac to my order and it looks like they used a teaspoon to put it on. This location used to be great, but it seems like they have no process to limit the amount of doordashes on top of online orders and in person. I get needing to keep business by offering delivery, but when it is at the expense of food quality, quantity, and service speed there should be something done. I've seen some crazy lines at Chipotle's before, but the amount of people who were all frequently sighing in desperation shows.<//review>

I love chipotle and the food is always great. But, this location always has issues! I've been there several times hours before closing and have been denied items such as steak or guac which are 2 of the best items! My family has had issues with call ahead orders here saying they won't make the food until "said time" even though no one was in line at the store and made my family member wait till "time" and did nothing between time. Recently I was charged for guac on 3 orders for tacos, burrito, and chips and guac but was informed by my dasher that the store said they will not have guac for the rest of the night. I just don't understand why this store falls short of service compared to other locations such as galleria.. I will never come to the chipotle location at pleasant grove ever again. I downloaded this app for positive reviews, but I've had more than 5 negative experiences with this location. I'm done!< /text>

I do not really care for this location,  I'm a vegetarian vegan at that , when I go in to get a veggie bowl I only get rice , guacamole,  corn and salsa , peppers,  when you ask for more rice or anything , they will look at you like you asking for to much , I dont even get the beans , meat , cheese etc so what's the problem??? I pay 8$ for what ? But the people getting meat have no problem getting full. Please change that way looking at things , I would like to get full< /Review>

<Review>Absolutely horrible staff. Ordered a steak burrito and the guy got the steak fresh from the grill, but barley bothered to cut up my steak. (Was literally cut with out bothered to be broken apart) or yet alone seasoned whatsoever. The most bland steak I have ever eaten. Staff was rude, and unprofessional. I do not recommend coming to this chipotle.< /Review>< Name>

Didnt tell me that having cheese melted on my burrito would cost 3 bucks when I could have just had cheese sprinkled on for free, and gave me no notifications to this until I approached them on how much the carne asada would cost and didnt tell me having cheese melted on my burritos tortilla would cost me so much. Basically bought a a second burrito with this ridiculously overpriced addons.<//review>< Pictures>

The last 3 times I've ordered my food from this location and its only this location, my food is so cold its like they have it sitting in the fridge?<//review>

< review>
Employees started working on newer orders before finishing older orders. Making many people wait close to a hour to pick up orders.

Employee would toss the food onto a table outside without reading out the names of the orders making a lot of delivery drivers have to walk up to the table and all try to read the name of the orders.

I would not recommend people ordering from here since they are unqualified to Handle large influx of orders at one time and keep orders organized in when to make them.</review>

First time ordering online for pickup.  Food was as requested, but bag was in wrong letter shelf (not a - e for last name or F-L for first name), which caused me to wait longer than I should have had to and food to ultimately be cold.  But the process was easy and food consistent.<//Text>

This is one of our favorite Chipotle locations, the staff is always super friendly, the portion sizes are always what you expect from a good location, and the flavor of the food is always seasoned well (you would be surprised at how many location have bland food). Overall we are very happy that this is our local Chipotle. Highly Recommend.</text>

<review>I don't want to be a Karen, but I have tried to give this Chipotle location the benefit of the doubt.. However, the past 4 times I have ordered ahead online an hour prior to pick-up, I have ended up waiting outside over 30 minutes to get my order and each time I get my order it is wrong / not the correct item.... I am super disappointed I have had such bad experiences at this location. I will now be avoiding this Chipotle and driving to a further location in hope for no mistakes on orders and less wait times!!!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>NOPE! So the corn was still frozen for the corn salsa, the steak was cold and the rice was slightly warm and the chips were super stail. My girlfriends bowl turned into soup when they put a huge spoon full of sour cream in it as well. The soda fountain had 4 sodas out of order and the water portion was not working either. They were very quick with their service though but one employee was quite rude with the way she was talking to the other employees.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>We get chipotle at least once every two weeks despite it being not so consistant, wrong orders at times,  not getting point with our orders,  off putting chickens at times, and not so friendly staff.  Why?   Good price for semi- healthy and tasty food and we didn't get sick after eathing little off putting chicken.    We swore off couple times but still go back because we are wiredly addicted to it or there's no explaination to why do we go there time after time with so many negative experiences.</text>< Date>

Placed an order for 6:45 pickup time.  Around 7:15 I gave up after seeing people with 7PM pickup time getting their orders.  Had to stand in line for another 15 minutes to place my order at the counter, only to have the staff try to argue that my order might be getting made in the back and to wait.

Came in at 9:40pm and they told me they will stop taking orders because they had too many online orders. No other customers were there, it probably would have taken them 2 minutes tops to make our order. Prioritizing online orders vs customers that took their time to show up in person is such a facepalm. Last time visiting this location. I hope this one star review is worth saving 2 minutes for them.

Now that I'm not eating meat I can eat here. I used to get food poisoning here 2 out of 10 times when I ate meat so I just couldn't. Loving the veggie bowls.</Review>

Does the food taste good at this location? Yes!

Can I get my food quickly or at a reasonable speed? Pretty much never.

The staff that works here are nice people but they move so slow and this location always has a line. I get that it's located in a busy shopping center but compared to the locations with higher foot traffic, like at Galleria and in front of the Sunrise Mall, this place moves at a snails pace.

I only come to this location when I have no other option (like when I don't get to pick the location I meet someone at).</Review>

I was told I needed to wait for 10 minutes for chicken to finish cooking so that it could be put in my burrito. I waited the 10 mins and then they called me to say my food was done. Opened it up when I got home and no chicken. What was the point of waiting. I tried to call and no one will answer.</Review>

<user>104048464653054644388<//user><pictures>None</pictures><review>I hate leaving any bad reviews ever, but this location is terrible. We placed an order today to have lunch delivered. We have done this before and got exactly what we wanted. Today we ordered extra meats for all the bowls and extra fajita veggies for one. We didn‚Äôt get any extra meat which we were charged for and none of the veggies. I tried to contact the restaurant after multiple calls finally got someone on the phone, was placed on hold for atleast 10 minutes and then the call was disconnected. I tried again and wasn‚Äôt able to reach anyone. This restaurant location definitely has let me down on multiple occasions before. My family loves chipotle we just won‚Äôt be coming back to this location or ordering from there ever again. I also just realized after looking in the bags we  didn‚Äôt get a chocolate milk with the kids meal. Just thought I needed to include this too, because it definitely sucks for a kid when they don‚Äôt get what they were wanting with their lunch too.<//review><Name>Sarah Andrade</Name>< Gmap_id>

Ordered through DoorDash at 830pm, at 10pm the delivery driver called me at stated that he has been waiting for over 1/2 hr to receive the food. Then the manager gets on the phone and tells me that they ran out of chicken. After I questioned her that they just didn‚Äôt want to turn the grill back on, she stated ‚Äúwell, we really didn‚Äôt run out, we just can‚Äôt make more, unless I wanted to wait for 15 more min. I ordered the food over 1 1/2 hrs ago and now they are at the end of the day and did not want to turn the grill back on?? The manager then hung up on me because I called her out on the lie. I will not order food there again, customer service did not come first. It was very obvious that it was at the end of their shift and just wanted to brush me off and go home. I cancelled the order and went somewhere else.< /Text>

Rude manager and employees. Refused to give me additional toppings of sour cream and cheese for kids build your own meal. Told us you had to take sour cream and cheese instead of proteins as a side. They told us the two small side containers charge for $1 extra each and didn't entirely fill them up even. Completely not worth it! Almost the same price as a regular bowl for less than half of the amount!<//text>

This restaurant was clean and the staff helpful.  My only complaints about Chipolte are they don't have a salsa bar; you have to buy chips separately and they only give you one small container of salsa. Also, I feel rushed through the line, but it does keep the line moving. This location was better than most in that the servers can hear what you say without shouting. Therefore, the restaurant was much quieter than most.< /Review>

<response>None</response><text>2 stars because it's still chipotle, but this place is really low quality compared to others in the area. In the last month ive gotten food here quite a bit, always the same.

Rice undercooked and underseasoned, some beans are undercooked. Cold,  very little meat. They stuff burrito mostly with rice (at least when you order online). Go to another chipotle location. I'm officially done with this one until I start seeing some new positive reviews.</text><time>1588273216363</time><username>Nate Harper< /username>< gmap_id>

<text>Every employee in there was rude and very short with me. That very large Mexican girl in the back that looks like she eats all the leftovers was very rude to me. I was wearing my mask and following all the guidelines. By the time I got home and got the food out for my family I noticed my orders were not right and they were just thrown in there with guacamole everywhere. I won't be going back there anytime soon<//text>< time>

We come here time to time and it's always a busy location. That keeps the lines  long but the food fresh so we continue to come since it's worth the wait. My only complaint is the tables are always dirty even the outside area. The chips & Guacamole are the best....</Text>

<review>Very bad service .
The person making a chicken burrito took tomato salsa from the chicken burrito and put it straight into to the tomato salsa bowl along with some pieces of chicken. I am a vegetarian and i saw it myself. Yuck gross. So we are supposed to eat tomato salsa touched with chicken wow.
I will never go back<//review></record></dataset><record>

Plenty of options for personalizing your bowl or burrito Inc a kid quesadilla meal option. As you go down the options line, you choose from 2 types of rice, black or brown beans, meat options, veggies,  salsas, sour cream and/or guacamole.  You can order chips, bottled sodas or fountain drinks. Something for everyone age 3 to 80.<//Review>

My go-to place when I need some quality and quick food. I usually will get a burrito with some of their lime chips and a soda and it is always a good time. I do also like there salsas as they taste pretty good. Often when my co-workers and I don‚Äôt have lunch Chipotle will be our backup and having it around the corner only makes it an easier decision.<//Text>

Very nice kids meal. My 5 year old is obsessed with this place tacos. I have removed  2 star because sometimes they mix meat with veg, and we are pure vegetarians. If only they make sure while serving meat that the juice out of it dont drip in veg dishes like rice and beans.< /Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>Ordered a meal online for pickup.  Meal for two was ready on time when I arrived.  Just walked in, picked up the meal and walked out.  Fast.  Easy.
Problem was both vegetarian burrito bowls were missing fajita vegetables and guacamoli.  The beans and brown rice were bland and didn't seem completely cooked.  Meal was not as good as I had experienced in other locations in the Sacramento area.  Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but this was the day I decided to introduce my wife to Chipotle.  Will be a good spell before I will be able to try again.< /text>< Pics>

Chipotle isn't bad by any means, it is pretty good for what it is. Ultimately it can be bad sometimes, it depends on when the food was last prepped, etc.</Text>

Love chipotle, this one can get very busy and they pretty much make mistakes as much as McDonalds when it comes to online ordering. The staff wont help the situation much either, pretty much managed and run by kids under the age of 20. Galleria has a much better location and they‚Äôre opening one by Top Golf, so you can bet I will be trying that new location over this mess.<//text>

This is a very busy location, food was as expected and good, but it was hard to find a table that was clean that day.  Ultimately we had to get napkins and wipe it down ourselves.  There is limited seating inside but they also have more seating on an outdoor patio.<//Review>

<text>The worst service I've ever had at Chipotle. This place is a disaster. Kenya was the manager on duty, they charged us for guacamole when we didn't order any and it took them 10+ minutes to figure out how to refund it. They didn't apologize once. We won't be back to this one.<//text>< pictures>

Fantastic restaurant. Tasty food. Healthier than fast food. Friendly staff. And the guacamole is to die for. Check it out if you've never been. And their new rewards program is very much appreciated.<//Text>

Which it happens, but the person waiting on us made our burritos and left them sitting
For quite awhile until the chicken was ready I say at least 5 minutes or more so the burritos were cold and the chicken wasn't cooked all the way so I ended up tossing mine into the trash no excuse for serving food cold and especially never serve chicken

<Review>Food was fine. Service on food prep, strange, 4 different people made each bowl. Like one person put out the bowl next person was rice n beans, a salsa person , a cheese, guac & sour cream. Then a lettuce person who closed the bowl. Just seemed too many hands for 1 bowl.<//Review>< response>

<text>Amazing just like the rest of there locations from the east coast to the west coast. I can't get enough Chipotle. It's amazing how great there customer service is no matter what location you go to. Save a few dollars from going to Mary's Pizza and get your family some fresh food here.< /text>< userid>

<Review>Busy, disgruntled, quick, and semi rude. I say rude because cashier grabbed a grapefruit drink and the customer before me stated that they ordered a Clementine and the cashier responds with, "are you sure?" Rude on my end because she dropped my items in my bag, causing a loss of my side of guacamole. I get it sucks being so busy, but it's no reason to look so disgruntled towards customers. Very off putting. Luckily I didn't lose much of my guacamole.< /Review>< pics>

I understand when your online system makes a mistake and loses my order, but then to take another 20 minutes to make the order? Ridiculous.  I watched 25 people go through the line after they lost my order, wont be coming back.<//review>

Chipotle is popular but it's only above average.
You don't get easy access to sauces and chips like most authentic Mexican places do.

The taste is ok but the food is barely spicy. You WILL need to add a lot of green tobasco sauce if you are used to spices.

I recommend Don Quixote over this place which is within a 1 mile radius from here.< /Review>

Go to the Galleria or better yet, get with a few friends and open up another franchise near Lincoln. Population is large enough you'll make a killing.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Always pretty busy, so plan enough time. Employees are very patient with the rude demanding customers I witnessed today. I give the customers in front of me 1 star only lol. The only reason I deducted a star is because some employees are so much more conservative with the food than they should be. I understand managing COGS, but sometimes it can be a bit ridiculous. I'm paying $11 for my salad and would appreciate more that a half spoon of meat and a tiny pinch of cheese. Not sure if it was the manager who was so stingy with food or what. That being said, I really appreciate that the are never rude about my annoying request for shredded lettace on my salad instead of the regular.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Very discouraged to order online again because when I picked up both of my orders were not exactly what I ordered on top of that missing guacamole on both of the orders that's $4.5 that I paid extra for nothing. Please have ur employees be more careful.</Review>

I‚Äôve been to many many chipotles nationwide. I eat it 2-3 times a week. This location is now my regular location based on where I live. Whether the food is dry, the line is understaffed, or the coke is ‚Äúout of order‚Äù this spot is the most consistantly bad branch I‚Äôve been to. That being said, I don‚Äôt blame any of the employees for any issue at all including their bad attitude. It‚Äôs management job to ensure none of these issues are going on. Whoever is the store manager needs to be replaced with someone who knows how to run a business.< /Review>

This Chipotlet always has fresh food, I see them changing the pans out & making it all every time I'm there.  It's always busy & a wait but it's worth it.  The service here has always been great also.< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Resp>None</Resp><text>My husband and I are regular chipotle customers and this location has really taken a turn downhill. We got there at 8:30 on a Saturday  night, and sign says they close at 10 but they were already closing the kitchen. No chips because they didn't want to turn on the fryer. Cilantro lime rice had no cilantro because they didn't cut it. The employees were extremely rude. We sat in the dining room and listened to them tell customers to go to freebirds across the street and talk bad and gossip about customers when they thought no one was in the restaurant. It made for a very awkward dine in experience. We will not be back.</text>< Time>

I love chipotle, but im giving this 3 stars as the workers there short you on every ingredient you ask for. I ordered a bowl qnd had to keep asking for more because they barely scoop up anything and put it in there. They cant even put an even layer of each ingredient. I find it completely retarded. If you come here hoping for a proper amount of food for the price your paying, dont. They skimp you out on everything. Very sad.< /Review>

<Review>Worst Chipotle on the planet, stale chips and tortillas, no flavor barbacoa beef that's ice cold, smallest burrito I have ever seen made.

I like Chipotle. Most Chipotle locations are clean, efficient, and decent places to eat.

This location however is extremely inefficient, poorly managed and generally awful. The staff is near incompetent, the lines can take absurdly long, and their selection is often limited by that as well.

Thankfully there are plenty of other Chipotle locations in proximity.</Review>

<Text>They consistently give smaller portions of food compared to other Chipotles. It's almost like the management pushes employees to skimp on ingredients. I have to order double meat just to get a standard meat serving. I usually drive an extra few miles to go to a different Chipotle but sometimes have to settle for this one.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Great food but tiny location and huge lines.   The line frequently goes to the back of the store during the busy times. There are only seats for 30 people inside the store.  There were 34 people in line at one time!   Not to mention the parking lot,  which also has two banks in it is tiny and you have to park halfway across the parking lot.   Why this location doesn't either move or open another one nearby is behind me.  Again,  great food,  good service,  but avoid during busy times unless you want to wait 15 mins just to order then have nowhere to sit.< /Text>

Terrible customer service, and the food wasn't even good! My son ordered a kid's meal and didn't want the rice and beans on the side. He wanted to substitute one cup of fruit for the sides; he had a choice of chips OR fruit, plus the 2 sides. The manager T.J. refused the substitution.

Not only was my son disappointed, but the chicken in my meal had gristle and fat mixed in, something that has never happened at a Chipotle before. We will not be returning to this location. Avoid it if you want an enjoyable dining experience.<//Text>

Dissatisfied with how employees are treated. As a customer,  I was MORTIFIED after I stood and watched staff clear a line of 25 people and 6 or 7 online orders and then be DENIED a drink of water. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE CHIPOTLE??????? You have staff stuck on a line with HOT food and a HOT torilla press but won't give them 30 to 45 seconds to get a drink of water??????? Geez, I need to rethink where I spend my hard earned dollars.<//text>

Best place to eat healthy EXCEPT FOR OVER SALTING!
TO MUCH SALT IS CAUSING A LOT OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. PLEASE USE LESS SALT!
ROSEVILLE CHIPOTLE NEAR NUGGET MARKET USES WAY WAY TO MUCH SALT!
WE ALL NEED A PLACE TO   EAT THAT IS HEALTY AND TEASTY.</text>

Didnt die from the plague like my girlfriend claimed I would.  Parking lot can be a bit crowded on weekends.  I had three people try to run into my truck.  Not Chipotle's fault but it did get my heart goin.< /review>

All I ordered was rice guacamole.  The serving of rice was surprisingly small.  Then, the rice was undercooked and crunchy.  It was disappointing to say the least.</text>

Super staff here, which makes a big difference. Quality meals. Loses a star for not having great outdoor seating or something like that to recommend it.<//text>

Dear Chipotle, if your online system offers a time that the food will be available,  please either A. Make sure it's done then or B. Make sure your staff is friendly enough to keep your guests coming back.</Text>

Long lines and poorly trained, constantly changing staff makes visiting Chipotle a chore. What I hate about Subway is exactly what I hate about Chipotle. The service does not make me smile.</review>

<Review>Called in a 2 item order, they told me 30 mins. So I showed up and they said they never got my order and ended up having to fill out an order on paper, it would have taken just as long to go in line which is why I called in an order.... I order veggie tacos and a side of guacamole, they said they would comp the guacamole even though with veggie anything a side of guacamole is already comped</Review><user>117104363292497599601<//user>< Pics>
