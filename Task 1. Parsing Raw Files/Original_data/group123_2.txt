<review>It was a nice ambience, sitting was out side on 4th street and their was good live music. We had the potatoes, shrimp, bbq guava wings and ceviche. Flavors were great.

Good food.  The prices are a bit high for my taste.  Did not like the bread pudding and I was so disappointed about that. The caramel sauce was very wine infused. My friend eat it up though. The fish tacos were a bit fishy for my taste. The chicken skewers were really good. And the plantains and  beans were delicious, just how I like my plantains. Had sangria, red, I didn't really like it. Maybe should have gotten the white. We sat outside, in the front because the inside was so warm and they were having a reserved party in the back. The waiter was nice giving us suggestiond to what to do in the area.< /review>

<rate>3< /rate><Review>The portion was very generous, however the sauce of my Cajun shrimp was so very thick (too much cream I'm guessing) that covered up the good flavor and became quite heavy half way through. Same thing with the chicken skewers. The meat was so nice and tender but the peanut sauce was so greasy that kinda ruined the dish for me.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeeT7MOze1ZbM4jYLgwHEiWxTRBKao-nJG6Bdo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMILhyVog1esrihALLajm6tDKHYvp1io5TT_Bcv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<text>This place is insane when it comes to making great food. Someone in my group was dissatisfied with one of the dishes and ordered something the new. The chef took the initiative to remake the meal without us asking while also giving us the new order. The remade food was absolutely great along with all the other food. This restaurant gets a 10/10 for quality and determination to satisfy the customer👌</text>< GmapID>

<Review>We were going to a concert at The Marin Civic Auditorium. Whipper Snapper came up as a top pick. It is worth a dine. Caribbean flare. Only reason not a 5 star is the service, although polite and helpful, was not efficient. Took a while to be waited on (only 2 other tableds were occupied when we arrived), and a table that was seated after us was waited on and served before we were.< /Review><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Great, food. I was a little disappointed with my service though. I came on father's day, which they were advertising specials for, but they only had one server helping the entire restaurant while I was there (from noon-2). When I went to order dessert, I found out they were out of 3 of the items of their 5 listed. The server was very nice, but I felt bad for her as she had to be flustered, as it was very busy and she was bussing the tables too. I would totally rate higher if they were not out of menu items and had the appropriate staff on deck so I did not have to wait so long.< /text>

I don't always buy into the "fresh organic ingredients" hype, but I can tell that this place uses great quality ingredients in all their dishes. The dishes are extravagant enough to make them worth the price but humble enough to make your night out cozy. They also have a great patio out back if you are looking to eat outside. One of my favorite restaurants in San Rafael.< /Review>

Loved the food and great service! Overall, seafood is the focus here compared to their meat dishes. Dessert was great but their cobbler was very mushy -- it'd be nice to have some texture or crispy something< /text>

One of my kids' favorite restaurants (15, 13, 11). Always easy to drop in there for a great meal. The mussels, potatoes, and shrimp side dishes are what we always order. The slow-cooked pork entree is one the best dishes I have ever eaten, but we usually order lots of everything and share.<//Review>

Ordered lunch for my team $61 for 3 people... The lady on the phone said it would be ready by 1145 as soon as I get there at 1146 the cook is rushing inside to start his shift to cook the food that was supposed to be ready to go... The cashier has me wait to so that she could get me a discount for the inconvenience only to ask me to pay the full price... My order consisted of 2 plates of jerk chicken which was nothing more than 2chicken thighs drowned in a dark tomato sauce the yellow rice was very hard and the beans just got lost in the very ample amount of sauce my coworker ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and she could not even eat it it was so burnt the absolute worst waste of $60 don't waste ur time with this place horrible customer service and even worse food</review>

Whipper Snapper has a nice vibe to it. Restaurant is nice and clean, they have a good patio. On their menu is some Caribbean choices which need some improvement. The Jerk chicken, mmnnn!! If you've had authentic jerk chicken then the recipe needs to changed, it's too much jerk sauce and it seems to be cooked earlier in the day. The pork shoulder ( chefs special) is just ok. We liked their Sangria. I would go back but choose something more American. At least our server is nice so that made the experience better.</Review>< userid>

Our family is Vegan so we are always searching for more incredible options while living in Marin County.

As a chef, I tend to make a vast majority of our foods at home.
My children are lucky enough to enjoy many of their favorite dishes which we find at restaurants but veganized and often more tasty at home.
Such as Pad Thai, Curries, Sushi, Bento, Tacos, German Kraut Brot, Burgers and more, we do in such a way as to be exquisitely good.

The Whipper Snapper has been a family restaurant for quite a few years and it is stationed very near many of our favorite haunts, such as Johnny Donuts for example.
The food is pretty good.

My recommendations are to innovate:

Since Caribbean Cuisine is comprised mainly of very fresh produce and fruits,  they could try using Beyond Meat products such as their sausages, and ground meats which are all vegan.
They could use Miyokos delicious vegan cheeses to tempt even the most devout carnists who love their meat to try it.

I have always had to find some options here and stitch them together for my family, just like Sol foods, but I don't think this should be something we vegans need to do much longer with the plethora of these exquisite vegan fake meats.

Beyond Meat is basically replacing the Animal when it comes to meat manufacturing. This will save us all way more $$ down the road and we all would be able to eat more of what we love.< /text>

I go there often, with my hubby for "date night", with my Rotary friends to support this wonderful couple (and to drink the sangria), and with my clients on casual-lunch days.  Good food (VERY generous tapas), good decor, excellent service, and a fun place.  What more can you ask for in this life, really?< /text>

Everything was wonderful, the sangria was not too strong and everything had a delicious flavor. For dessert I ordered the fruit mousse (something I wouldn't normally consider for the lack of chocolate) and loved it! I would order everything again in a heartbeat. The only thing I would recommend is I felt a little "upsold" on food, but it was all very good. Highly recommend eating here!<//review>< Pictures>

We don't go out to dinner often, but of the places we go, the most frequent is to Whipper Snapper. Sure, it helps to be only 15 minutes away, but the food, beverages and prices meet our needs perfectly. The wife often has the hot spinach salad while I bounce all over the menu; the quesadillas frequently show up as part of my meal. Others love the fish taco. The sangria is very good.
BTW: No complaints about the music, the volume is never loud; even if it were, I know the staff would turn it down if asked. Loud music is a major pet peeve of mine.</Review>

<text>If you want a concert and be blasted out with loud music this is the restaurant to establish. The food is good, however the music was so loud it vibrated back and forth on the walls. A request to turn it down was refused. Myself and two other ladies were the only ones in the restaurant. I had to leave.  Enjoy the concert.< /text>< user_name>

<Time>1521865091718<//Time><rate>5< /rate><Text>This is one of my all time favorite places to eat.  If you’re new to the Taiwanese style eating experience I would start off with a #28 Fried Chicken Egg Roll or #18 Slicy Mini Wonton, entre with some #53 Sausage Fried Rice, #71 Seafood Fried Noodle, #95 Beef Stew Noodle, or #47 Pork Chop Rice.  My personal favorites, #19, #40, #136, #157, #195, and pretty much the rest of the menu.  Gotta go, the food is here.</Text>< pics>

One thing that kinda throws me off is the awkward location of the waiting and restaurant, as it blocks the path from the mall to Nordstrom. Besides that, the food is pretty good, except for the fact that the dishes may be smaller than expected and a bit over priced.< /Review><UserId.>102335406479787368780</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

We order pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, green beans, And shanghai style rice cake.
Everything was extremely Deli sh and not to mention the service was attentive and friendly.</text>< Pics>

I love their fried chitterlings, stinky tofu, and taiwanese egg omelette thingies. They also now have corn juice which is actually really good. Why not 5 stars? There's always a little something that can be improved on with regards to service. For example, the last time I went, I ordered the shrimp omelette and they brought out the oyster omelette.</Text>

<text>Food is very good. All the negative reviews are from haters who can’t stop hating. They are just butthurt customers who don’t like anything they see. This is one of the best Taiwanese restaurants I have been too. Their popcorn chicken is very good too.< /text>< name>

<text>The quality of the food is pretty bad, they probably just buy the food from any market and warm it, I never tasted something like that before! A huge surprise and not a good one.
Plus, I've been there on Christmas eve, everyone might be happy, this is what i thought, but the waitress proved me I was pretty wrong, she was pretty rude to any customers, including me, and didn't hesitate to say a lot of bad things about customers in Chinese to an other waitress!
If you can avoid, do it !!!</text><user>108169728106898843915<//user>< time>

This is a Taiwanese food restaurant in the Atlantic Times Square. It is a medium size place and lots of seats by the window. Not a lot of decor but it's a clean restaurant and it could fit a few large groups in here. I have here a dozen of times and I think their food is solid. Lots of traditional Taiwanese food could be found here and they taste like how I remembered them. Price is about $1 more per dish than other similar style restaurant, but I like the setting here. One thing to remember is that you shouldn't come here for dumplings or northern China food here. I come here for Taiwanese food and it's worth a trip.< /text>

One of the few decent Taiwanese food in the area.  My favorite includes Fried Pork Chop Rice, Oyster PanCake, Chicken Rolls, Pop corn Chicken, too many to mentions.  Highly recommended.< /review>

this place used to have multiple locations when I used to stay in LA. Been going to this restaurant since 1990. Every year I go back to LA and this is the first restaurant I go to and then a couple times throughout the week and definitely the last restaurant I go to when I fly back to Atlanta. If this place ever closes I will cry. Favorite dish is the squid noodle soup, it's heaven in a bowl.</Review>

Stumbled upon this restaurant with a friend as we were craving some Korean food! Ordered through a touch screen computer and waited outside until food was ready. Very quick and easy! We ordered tteokbokki! It was very good, perfect amount of sweet and spicy. Prices are fairly cheap with good proportions!<//review>

My go-to Korean restaurant in Berkeley. A lot of seating and menu options that are delicious! Great environment and family friendly. Kind and polite staff services. Cheap and good prices compared to other restaurants near the university.< /Text>

The thukbokki (spicy rice cakes ) is also full of flavor - sweet and spicy (spicier than the fried rice) but so good! My favorite was the fried seaweed rolls and dumplings (I dipped them in the thukbokki sauce and it was a perfect combination). Totally would eat here again when I'm in the area. Friendly service too!< /Text>

Ordered take out: thukbokki, kimchi fried rice with pork, fried dumplings and fried seaweed rolls. Everything was piping hot and well enjoyed in our car. They take social distancing seriously - order at a kiosk and wait outside until your order is ready. The kimchi fried rice with pork is amazing! Not too spicy but full of flavor and depth.</review>

Good food, reasonable prices. Open during lockdown for takeout/pickup. They are pretty fast and have hand wipes and hand sanitizer. Their kimchi friend rice is very very good.< /text>

It's really nice how they have complementary miso soup. In addition, being able to help yourself to any utensils you might need is super convenient. The food was great and was served fast. Some things that could be approved less spam cause I don't like spam<//text>

No-Frills Eatery, order at the counter. Very reasonable student prices, two can have a good dinner for $30. Good meat for the barbecue and very tasty. Not so loud that you can't have a good conversation there. Lively neighborhood which is fun to walk around. Kimchi Garden is tucked away and upstairs but worth finding, the nappa Kimchi is fresh and delicious.<//review>

<Text>it was recommended by the cab driver . the service was good ,the restaurant was empty. half way through the meal another customer came in and they were alone so invited them to join us and that seemed to put everyone at ease staff including. it was around midnight left with some soup  and found some of the best  doughnuts known . its close bye like 2 min walk i believe . find that you wont regret it<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<text>Recently the management/ownership has changed. The service was very good, very friendly!! The portions are very large. The food came out quickly and tasted homemade. I come here whenever I'm in the area. If you want Korean food, come give it a try. It's very homey.<//text>< response>

I ordered the Dolsat Bibimbap ($10 or $11 i believe) with beef. I was really disappointed as they gave me 4 VERY SMALL pieces of beef which was about 2 small bites. Also, the self serce miso soup didn't taste right.
Good customer service.
If I return I will NOT order the dolsat bibimbap again.</review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80857c2f1532bf9b:0x28d192dfce89c7ef</gmap_id></record>

I ordered a fried rice omlette and it was great! Well-presented, amazing flavour, and massive portion size! You can also self-serve miso soup for free.

The only criticism I have is that their tables are oddly small, so it feels a little crammed when you have 4 people to a table that is better suited to two or three people.</Review>

Their beef bulgogi was dry, Theo selection of drinks could be updated, small cans. Pretty expensive for the quality of food</text>

It is very close to the university and very convenient. My friends and I go to this restaurant when we want good Korean food. They have delicious rice with vegetables, noodles, and of course kimchi. If you like inexpensive Korean food, I recommend Kinchi Garden! You need to try!

Кимчи Сад мой любимый корейский ресторан в Беркли! Он находится совсем недалеко от университета, и очень удобный. Мы с друзьями ходим в этот ресторан когда мы хотим хорошую корейскую еду. У их есть очень вкусный рис с овощами, лапша, и, конечно, кимчи. Если вам нравится недорогая корейская еда, я рекомендую Кинчи Сад! Вам нужно попробовать!</Review>< Pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) It's a bit of American sweetness to Korean flavors.
It's not bad.

(Translated by Google) It's at University of Berkeley, and it's a good homestay! The atmosphere in the restaurant is also active and I remember it was good.

<Text>(Translated by Google) A Korean restaurant that fits most Korean tastes around Berkeley. Just a restaurant! Very friendly to run by the host family.

I’ve been to many Ethiopian restaurants and this simply tops all of them. Addis restaurant not only provides amazing food but also gives off  the peak Ethiopian dining atmosphere with music, drinks, traditional furniture, etc... I would highly recommend for family dining as well as a quick healthy meals.<//review>

The restaurant is simple and clean, but the smell needs incense.(እጣን) we got horrible customer service.I know how I treated my customers when I was working at a Habesha restaurant. Of course I tipped her because if she is a server that is her income. We ordered tibs and kitfo. The tibs and salad was nice but my choice kitfo was cooked like tibs even the test was not good 😌 any ways ከፍትፍቱ ፊቱ</Text>

Since the shutdown started, I have ordered takeout from here a few times, and they package up everything so well. It makes eating with the injera and your hands so easy (and mess free). Highly recommend if you're looking to try out a local Ethiopian place.

This place is so awesome! They offer such a delicious and fun experience when dine-in is available.</Review>

It tasted like my mom’s cooking and there is no better cook than my mom so this place felt amazing. At the end order a nice hot cup of tea or hot coffee, it comes with the myrrh incense ;) I felt transported to mother Africa the mother of mothers.</Review>

Really enjoyed my meal! Price was great, food was tasty! It was my first experience with Ethiopian cuisine, so I can't speak to authenticity, but it was a nice experience.

I let them convince me to order my food at a 4 spiciness level instead of the 5 or 6 I originally asked for. It was delicious, but not the runny nose level I intended to order! I tend to prefer spicier foods though 😊. If you typically order spicey foods at Indian or Thai restaurants, you should be fine here too, similar spice scale.

If you're nervous to try something new, look up Ethiopian cuisine guides online and read a little about what to expect (what to order, how to eat, etc). Staff was nice, and can help you choose something!

Give it a try!!</review>

Wow...just wow. What a great experience from the food to the atmosphere. I may as well have been in Africa but shockingly I am still in California. I must say the food is ethnic. A taste of Africa right here in San Diego. This is on my "hot list" which means places I must visit again. Thank you for a great time!<//review>

<Review>The best Ethiopian restaurant in all of California! The food was delicious and the atmosphere is amazingly great. I’m the type of person who doesn’t like to wait their food but this place was a family owned and they were extremely nice and very likable people. So I didn’t mind the wait. I highly recommend this place if you like Ethiopian food. Wish I could give them a thousand stars.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Wow...just wow. What a great experience from the food to the atmosphere. I may as well have been in Africa but shockingly I am still in California. I must say the food is ethnic. A taste of Africa right here in San Diego. This is on my "hot list" which means places I must visit again. Thank you for a great time!<//Review>

<text>It was great experience in  Ethiopian Restaurant .  They bring your food in a big shared dish 🍱 .  There is special spongy bread 🥖  which you eat your food with hand in the shared dish . 🤪
There is parking lot in rear too . Don’t forget to try the coffee ☕️ .<//text>< pics>

I was pleasantly surprised at the service and the delicious food! Family run and very kind people. Excellent prices and it was fun to watch the Ethiopian videos on the TV. I look forward to going back again! Oh and another bonus is that they now serve beer and wine!< /Text>< pics>

<text>I went to this restaurant earlier this week 40 minutes before closing. They let us in and didn't appear to be pushing us out or rushing us like most places tend to be when you show up close to closing. The food was delicious and seasoned well. We got two meals family style and left full and satisfied. Food came out fairly quickly and service was good. Only complaint is that the food could have been warmer. Might have been because we were there so late. Still tasted fresh. We will be returning.<//text><userid>107686098816363286844<//userid><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

It was our first time trying Ethiopian food and we drove over 30 minutes down from north county to try it out. There are a few in this area to choose from and we went to this one! We loved it! The ambience was relaxed and comfortable and there were neat traditional decorations and seating options. We had a veggie and meat platter that was delicious. Our first time trying injera and I loved the sour taste to it! It added even more complexity to the variety of flavors and spices to each different sample of dishes! The owners were very kind and obliging! We really loved the food and the place! So glad that we picked this one to go to!</Text>

Slowest service I've had in a long time. There were only 2 other tables with people when we arrived, but still waited an hour for our meal. Our sambusas arrived still partially frozen. We had to specify which water cups we wanted, otherwise they would only fill one glass at the table and walk away. Food was ok -- definitely not bad, but not amazing either. It was a surreal experience. While the staff seemed kind enough, they real just didn't have any concern at all about running the restaurant. That said, it was relatively inexpensive and decent food.<//Text>

A friend and I went to this place the other day. The service was great, the food was even better, and the prices are unbelievably reasonable.<//text>

Walked in to a beautiful restaurant with great cheap food. I don't understand why this place was so empty. The tea alone is worth the visit.<//text>

Ethiopian food at its best.
First the ambiance super clean and nicely decorated. we chose the flexible seating :). unique but little unconformable. haha. fun for the kids.

The owner was super sweet. they bring out fire roasted smokey coffee beans to neutralist the smell. it was actually refreshing.

we got veggie Combo - comes with most of the veterinarian dishes with the ethiopean delicacy injara (bread). AMAZING.

Fule - Kind of spicy curry dish. superb.
Fasolia - Beans and carrotts dish, amazing.

all the dishes we got are shareable and communal eating style.

This is an amazing option for vegetarians.

We had the Ethiopian Tea, was ok. nothing too great or different about it.

Plenty of street parking and private parking behind the building.< /Text>

Great place for an inexpensive, but stiff drinks.  They stay open late and don't have a problem with dress codes or anything that other places in Turlock sometimes get funny about.  Always playing music you'd love to sing along to when enjoying a buzz.<//text>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Checked it out last night for the first time with my wife and it was a great environment. Big issues though that should be fixed. We had the table that was closest to the restrooms. That table is not sturdy, people kept bumping into it knocking down our drinks a couple times. Money down the drain. It should be screwed down or something. Wife put money into jukebox, hour passed by and nothing. Multiple females go into the restrooms and take forever inside, they should only be allowed one at a time so they don't take selfies and/or do all their bs in there while people need to actually use the restroom. Despite that, their bartender made my Irish trash cans well executed.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Staley's, oh the memories. What can you expect? If you make it in early enough in the evening you can get a good seat. This bar gets packed quick on the weekends. Beer is affordably priced. Shots and mixed drinks are inexpensive. Bar does offer outside seating besides indoors. Bartenders are good folk. This is by no means a 5 star bar, it's more of a 3 star dive bar that's really inviting and provides an unrushed atmosphere. This bar is close to more bars downtown, restaurants, fast food, taco trucks and more. Bring a friend and enjoy the night. 4 stars instead of 5 is because its definitely not imitating a high end place. Also at times, people will play some very very badly chosen music on the jukebox, which could be an annoyance. Another thing is, there's no food available here besides some peanuts and chips. See you there.<//Review>

<Text>Extremely disappointed with this company in these uncertain times you auctioned off my storage knowing I had been in direct communication with the manager as to my situation with unfortunate events that caused me to fall behind. Where is your code of ethics on humanity in these uncertain times? I'm a single mother of 4 who had our whole apartment belongings stored in one of your units personal, sentiments, along with my deceased mothers ashes. Who would want to auction off someone's whole life? You left me completely with nothing you took my home, memories..... I can't even fathom being able to express the heartache and desperation I'm having to tell my girls everything we owned is now gone. Thank you Stor America for your understanding and compassion in these uncertain times.

This is a response to the management and or owner who responded to my review and took it down. You are absolutely right about being in direct communication with the manager at the site that was the only true statement in your response. Everything else lies, nothing was ever offered to me despite my requests even my partial payments were denied, I had paid up until June. So your decision to auction off my unit was not for 6 months of non payment it was for 2 months July and August you auctioned off in September. The day of the auction is when i was  told you would waive the fees which was then $400 to be able to save my unit I had $200 which you refused to take and is extremely heartless for a company to auction off my personal belongings for $400 in a time of a world wide pandemic. My mother's ashes, pictures, sentiments, everything was personal all gone for $400. Heartless is an understatement. I hope you got the money from the auction of my storage  you needed for your business to stay a float in these hard times.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1603929857978, 'text': 'Dear Stephanie,\nWe understand these are challenging times for our customers, just as they are for our business. Due to the pandemic, we had cancelled at least 6 months of auctions since March. In addition to that, we have waived several of your fees and offered you a generous vacate deal. Our team had been in regular contact with you, communicating to you that your unit would be up for auction and presenting you with options to save your belongings. Unfortunately, we never heard back from you by that deadline, and this review is the first we’ve heard from you since before the auction. While we regret that your items were sold, auctions are necessary for the storage industry and resuming our auction activities are a sign of our business returning to normal. Thank you for your feedback.\nRegards,\nManagement'}</Resp>

Nice guy but, was suppose to have use of a truck.. and did not because of covid 19 ...understandable.   but, they should have dropped the administration's fee to compensate for having to go rent a truck for 75 dollars ..< /Review>

My rating is a suggestion not an experience review. I have not interacted or visited this place.
I am not usually so quick to judge, but this is the 2nd StorAmerica location website I've browsed tonight that is in my area and it has absolutely NO PRICES listed for the units.
Yes, I can understand that stating ....
*Rate too low to show - PLUS $0 First Month Rent!

Call Now For Your Discounted*

... seems like a good idea to get business, but not to me. I can't imagine I'm the only that feels that with a business of this type, ppl will shop around for the best prices. Office hours can be limited for speaking to a live person. So...I suggest your company slap some numbers down on your units! I want to see prices! Let the specials be something to call about if you feel you must be mysterious. But for myself, I like to see all the info front of me. ALL of it.

Put some prices on your website, I bet your business will improves or at least the phones will ring more.</Review>

Other places do not prorate rent, but with notice, Sunnymead Mini-Storage made it possible for us to pay partial month rent to move out before the end of thr month. THE BEST PART IS THE BASICALLY FREE MOVING TRUCK!! For only $20, we moved in a truckload (2 bedroom apartment). They didn't even have us gas up the truck!

<Text>Found the storage place to be clean and well maintained.  Prices were fair and in most cases cheaper than other local storage facilities.  I would definitely use their facilities again.  Working on putting things in storage on a hot day the employees provided me with cold water.  :)   They were friendly and helpful.   I would go in to make a payment, having a rough day the ladies would offer me a hug which was needed that day.

They have the first-month rent special but what they fail to tell you is that a month can be 31 days or 1 day long. If you lease a unit for a week or two before the month ends, guess what? You WILL be CHARGED, apparently, the first of the following month. They have called, informing me of late charges ($20) and now the female voice also mentioned the possibility of auction charges being added to everything. They locked me out of my unit now and it seems I must pay the entire bill in order to gain access to my stuff (ow and an $11 charge for "protection plan"?). Which I plan to take out of the unit now anyway. The payment is considered late after the 10th. The 11th they start sending emails and leaving voicemails. I assume it is also when they lock a person out. By the 14th they start threatening with auction. Begrudgingly, I have no other alternative but to relent to their insipid exigencies in order to regain the one day access required to move out my things. Best of luck to those who choose to use Sunnymead Self-Storage on Indian St.<//Text>

If you're running low, missing that key item or want to create a picnic lunch, this is the right spot.

The two ladies behind the counter are charming and friendly.

There's a deli inside (I didn't get a sandwich but check other reviews) a case of cold ❄ beer and softdrinks, a rack of chips, wine and souvenirs.

In the rear of the store, check out the freezers with local beef 🥩, ground beef, and beef bones.</review>

I am now employed here. It has been a favorite of mine for years. Great sandwiches, smoked salmon, owner raised beef available all year. A unique place to be sure.< /Review>

Great place to grab some supplies for your road trip to the beach. Tons of beers to pick from and in house smoked meats. Sandwiches, chips and other things you may need including dog food as we found out because we forgot to pack some for our impromptu camping trip.</review>

<Text>If your into historical buildings then this place is worth a stop if you happen to be in the area. Stopped by here real quick to grab a couple of things while staying with a friend for the weekend on a coastal fishing trip. The building looks early 1900s and is decorated with little antiques here and there to compliment that old school general store vibe. As a general store goes it's pretty basic (pricey due to the lack of any grocery store competition in the area), but carries some cool local products. What they do have in the back is a deli that makes some pretty good sandwiches (with healthy portions of meat)! They do their own smoked turkey, roast beef and pastrami in-house......I had the smoked turkey and it was awesome. The turkey had good flavor, was thick cut and wasn't dry (which is important if your going to add a healthy portion to the sandwich). I added bacon and cheddar and was in heaven (after a long morning of fishing)! If your ever in the Jenner area and need something for lunch give it a try.....</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
A friend recommended that I check out this deli. I walked in and there were only a couple of people in the store. I filled out a sandwich sheet and ask the woman behind the counter if I could hand her my order. She told me to, "leave it wherever, I will get to it eventually." I thought this oddly rude, but left my order and walked around the to check out the market.  I needed chicken and was glad to see they had Rosie, a local organic company,  sadly all the meat was frozen and horrendously over priced.  I can get the same chicken at Safeway for $3 less a pound, and it's fresh. ( Which is what I did.) After waiting for ten minutes the rude woman making sandwiches informed me she was going to help some people that she knew and I would just have to wait. I told her not to make the sandwich, and walked out. I went across the hwy to Gold Coast Coffee and had a wonderful barista help me I had an outstanding savory pastry with turkey, pesto, and cheese. Yum! And, they are made in house. I will not be returning to this overpriced, underwhelming,  hole in the wall store.</Review>

This family run business is regular stop for us. Quite busy, but worth the wait. The sandwich people hustle and don't waste your time. The smoked meats made on the premises and are off the hook. The frozen grass fed beef is amazing, you can see the cows your eating on the hill sides near by.  You have to try the smoked beef jerky by the register. Killer apple bread and great smelling soaps.</Text>

The sandwiches are to die for made to order with great care and personal service you can't help but to love it

But be warned you may face some side effects like being overjoyed remembering what real food taste like and thinking happy happy thoughts.<//Text>

Organic produce and a wonderful selection of frozen meats. Some of the grass fed beef is raised by the owner himself. Also lamb, pork, chicken, and more. Awesome sausage from Healdsburg too, see if you can find the provincial pig, it's absurdly good. Friendly staff, accepts credit cards.< /text>

Awesome staff, and a great old building as well.
After the Russian River flood ('19), my fiancee and I left Guerneville for a day trip, only to find businesses covered with green, yellow and red tags - designating if or not they are habitable, can serve, et-cetera.
Duncan Mills General Store were one of the few places doing business on Saturday, March the 2nd, and went out of their way to make us both breakfast croissants, complete with eggs, ham, cheese, et-cerera.
I was impressed with both their kindness and care.<//Text>

<Text>Was looking forward to a sandwich at this store deli. It was the day before 4th of July. I filled out my sandwich sheet after being cut in front of by a local bum. The big blond women making sandwiches said put your order up here on the counter. There were 3 orders of sandwiches ahead of mine. I waited about 15 mins she completed 2 orders in that time, 3 SONOMA COUNTY SHERRIFS come in, they filled out their 3 orders and my order was pushed back 4 more sandwiches. I waited another 15 mins and watched her make the officers sandwiches. I had been waiting and standing at the counter watching this women make sandwiches to be passed up totally intentionally. My husband and I left without our sandwiches.  I will never go back to this hoe down, run down, market ever again. To the Big Blond Sandwich maker, I bet you ate our sandwiches we left hope you choked.</Text>< Resp>
{'time': 1499564541616, 'text': "Hi Kristen, My name is Daryl Anderson my wife and I own the Duncan's Store. I apologize for the bad experience you and your family had at our store.\n\nI will take full responsibility for the issues that you encountered. This year the popularity of our deli has gone through the roof, going from 20-30 sandwiches a day to numbers in the hundreds per day. Since your experience I have implemented a chronological system of keeping track of sandwich orders, I should have done this sooner.\n\nThe day you visited was the busiest day our store has ever had. After speaking with the employees that worked on that day I think that they were overwhelmed, under staffed and just didn't have the tools to serve the unexpected number of customers that we got that day. I understand you getting caught up in the anger of the moment but please know that we really do have a great group of friendly employees.\n\nOn a lighter note, I think I recognize your family from High School Rodeo right?  Our daughter barrel races also."}<//Resp>

<Text>I had Brett Semrick as my artist and can easily say that I had an amazing time there. The entire place was very clean and very professional, but were always willing to crack jokes and make you feel comfortable. They also cater to all types, as I was getting my (9th?? Idk) piece in very heavy black and grey, and across from me was a lovely young lady getting a delicate butterfly as her first piece. The pricing was also pretty damn good for the large piece I got. Overall very very happy! Def going back next time I’m in San Diego.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO16uvVUthJf3GHMU9lxkkPMpVLPfwQqLoObdLx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< gmap_id>

I have been to many tattoo shops throughout my life. Most of the shops I have been too have had great artist. Occasionally, I stumble across a shop that just impresses me. Remington is one of the shops. I have gotten 5 tattoos from 3 different artist (Terry, Gustavo, and Shannon)  at Remington and I must say every experience has been phenomenal. The artist are professional and show an incredible amount of skill and technique in tattooing.</Text>

<text>Remington is such a great tattoo parlor. It's full of extremely talented artists, each with their own unique and professional style. It is clear there is a standard for the quality of the tattoos and the artist themselves, and that quality is excellent! I have had multiple visits with Jasmine now, and I have finally found a tattoo artist I trust, appreciate, and really like! I also brought my husband for his first tattoo  he can't get over how amazing it is! Jasmine is not only a fantastic artist, but she's fun, great to chat with, and honest. She is quick but extremely thorough and her tattoos are beautiful. She is gentle as you can be with a needle, and she is very aware of her clients feelings, pausing as needed and constantly communicating. She, like the rest of the staff are amazing artists and run a well oiled machine and give vibrant, lasting tattoos! This shop is amazing and HIGHLY recommended! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZEVc6scMnReyt-n1OOoItVlRMiSyA4G1v6hu3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPq8tHSeeHIdsJEQ_Oi-4coynfJY9WlTPu1hgxr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkGz-nd45KlSMbX6fbKgHj4zX1J-abRoXokO10=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3VvM6JJANvYJAj5Y81ndTHfPCH6v2OUeDo6EQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1a-rwEIdcfCWYKwjj-2C8WTpAzVZI3sdy6fMG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>{'time': 1579997106822, 'text': 'Thank you Rachel!

A super rad tat parlor. Located in North Park, its the real deal, and I've look everywhere.... These guys combine new age tech to view their portfolios with the old school tattoo techniques of hand drawing the best art you'll find around. Plus, the guys are super friendly and easy-going.< /review>

<text>I have had 2 of my tattoos done by Jasmine. I absolutely love the way they both came out!  I love what she designs for me based on my  general ideas. I completely trust her to take my big picture and put her own style into it. The colors are so vibrant and the detail is incredible!  Her communication is great and she responds to me so quickly. My tattoos have healed so well and there hasn’t been any fading at all.  I have more tattoos I want and I will definitely be going to Jasmine!<//text>< Pics>

Terry did my work and in addition to being a very gifted artist, he is patient, professional, and knowledgeable in his field. From his vast experience, he knows what types of tatoos and colors work best and stand the test of time. He covered most of my back with a custom design, and I always get compliments on his incredible work. I sat for 10 hours total, and I have to say he made it as pleasant as possible. Definitely book here if you want an amazing tattoo that will last.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdht_2M8IoidxcmlinxXJjgAmilfO0MBQwXqgx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

<review>I spent as decade looking for someone whose vision and skills I would trust. I found Terry. As you can see from his portfolio his artwork is incredible, he has a unique vision and style, and is very efficient and knowledgeable as a practitioner. Your tattoo will look amazing, and continue to look amazing as it ages. What started as a single moderate size piece continued into a full sleeve, and other pieces followed. I couldn’t be happier. While their I’ve seen the work that other artists were doing and they were all excellent. I watched them turn down work because they wanted the person to be sure of what they were doing, and not take getting ink lightly. All in all a very pro shop with great artists. You can’t go wrong.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1579996812983, 'text': 'Thank you Alan for your Kind Words.  Your Octopus is one of my favorite tattoos.

Last week I got a tattoo of two of my cats by Jasmine Worth. The piece looks beautiful, even during this healing process. Jasmine was extremely communicative, friendly, and lovely to work with. The shop was awesome, great experience all around and I’ll definitely be back for more work ❤️ Thank you!! Definitely recommend Jasmine and this shop for everyone looking for quality work.</text>

Completely great experience at Remington. Jasmine Worth was great at talking through some ideas, and then creating something really beautiful. I'd come back in a heartbeat. Super great shop, incredibly talented artists all around it, by the looks of the art on the walls.</Text>

<username>judyth gomez< /username><Review>I got a tattoo covered up that was on my foot and it was great. It was affordable for the great quality. My tattoo artist Terry was careful, safe, and very hygienic. I recommend him to anyone, he’s quick and efficient. He pays attention to every detail, and doesn’t waste any time. I truly recommend him. You won’t regret getting a tattoo from Remington Tattoos.< /Review>< gmapID>

Jasmine is so incredibly talented. She’s done 2 tattoos on me (more to come!), and I couldn’t be happier with them. Her colors are always so saturated and vibrant, and she pays so much attention to all the details in the tattoo as well. She’s so easy to work with and can create the most beautiful piece out of the simplest ideas. I cannot recommend her enough.<//Text>

<Text>I had two tattoos I was looking to cover up. I found Terry's portfolio and I was sold. He was booked out for a year but it was definitely worth the wait. The consultation was great. He actually sketched out the tattoos in front of me which I thought was very cool. I had 8 appointments total. Each one went very well. I could not be more happy with the results. Terry is definitely a great artist.<//Text><Name>Eric Satterthwaite<//Name>< time>

First off, Remington Tattoo Shop has the most professional staff that I've met at any tattoo shop. The artists are well trained. Their equipment are well-maintained. Also, they have a high degree of sterility with their methods-including OSHA health compliance.

The quality of their art speaks for itself-brilliant custom designs in color or black and grey. Terry did an amazing job completing two full biomechanical sleeves (wrist-shoulder). When I had a concern with a detail to be changed to my liking, he would adapt and improve the design.

This is a premium quality shop that I would recommend to anybody.</Text>

<text>I’m currently in the process of having my tattoo done by Terry. I spent a lot of time prior to choosing an artist viewing different work. It was important to me that I chose the right artist because the piece I’m having done is a memorial for my Mom. I’m beyond ecstatic at how the tattoo looks so far and it’s further reassured me that I chose the right artist. I provided Terry with a general idea and he came up with something better then I had expected. He is an extremely talented artist and really aims to make sure his customers are happy. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking to have work done. Thank you Terry!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1575422352831, 'text': 'Thank you for your super kind review.

Jasmine came as a recommendation by a close friend, who had a couple of her tattoos.  When I saw her Instagram, I fell in love with her style.  She did my first big tattoo, was really helpful about healing processes, and very reliable and responsive.  At this point, she's done 2 of my bigger tattoos over the last 3 years.  She is incredibly talented, sweet, and easy to work with. Her designs are flawless- I love her spell tattoos.  At this point, Jasmine has tattooed a handful of my friends, who are all in love with her work. 10/10, would recommend!<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Terry is a beast. I contacted him for my first tattoo and he made the whole process so comfortable and smooth. If you choose Terry as your artist (congrats for the smart decision) expect the process to go something like this:
1. Send email or call shop about idea and location of tattoo.
2. Put down your deposit to reserve your dates. He is usually booked at least 6 months out.
3. His assistant will confirm and book all sessions in advance with you. Each session will be at least two weeks apart. Full sleeve for example is 8 sessions. Keep that in mind for traveling/holidays, it takes awhile.
4. During your first appointment, Terry will draw the whole tattoo right in front of you. It’s awesome.
5. Watch Terry make your natural skin color disappear at mind bending speeds.
Remington is a shop full of awesome artists and they are all super friendly. This shop isn’t for those wanting a design they found on Pinterest traced on their skin. Not that they wouldn’t do it, but the artists here can all draw and you pay for what you get. Let them draw you something custom no one else will have, you won’t regret it.< /text>< pictures>

<review>I've had a quite a few tattoos done by Jasmine at Remington Tattoo and I've recommended her to numerous friends and family members in the past, who have all loved her work.  She responds promptly and is always really involved with you in the process of planning your tattoo.  She's got her own unique personal style to her work which is beautiful but she's also great at working with you to ensure that your final piece ends up the way that you personally envisioned it.  Her prices are great for the quality of her work and I look forward to getting more pieces done by her in the future!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Terry, he is the best artist I have ever meet. I have to agree with others, Terry takes the time and sit down, and he draws your art work right in front of you no cut and paste with him. I have been to other high end shops and their artist are stuffy and want to charge you top dollar for average art work. Wish all of my tattoos were done by Terry. Terry is worth the wait.</Text>

Terry and the rest of the crew are true professionals. The atmosphere is calm, clean and focused on making high quality art.

I've had 2 pieces that became 1 done by Terry, and going back in December to start a new one. Terry's illustrative style combined with traditional is vivid and colorful and bold that is definitely going to hold for years to come. I came to Terry with a few ideas and a couple references and he brought my vision to life, and for that I can't thank him enough.

Can't recommend Remington enough to anyone who will listen.< /text>

Came to Remington Tattoo specifically for Brandon Macario, who was recommended to me by many people I worked with.

Considering this was my first tattoo, Brandon and everyone else at the shop was very helpful, very passionate about what they do and definitely went out of their way to make sure what I wanted came to light. They accepted with open arms which now a days is very hard to find.

Will be coming back soon to continue the work on my arm and hopefully add more to other places. Thank you Brandon!<//Review>

My experience with Terry Ribera - the owner has been really amazing.  I came to him with an idea for a side piece I wanted and he made it come to life with amazing color, design, and amazing attention to detail.  I can't go to another artist moving forward after having someone like him do work.  He's often booked and may take some time to get in, but well worth the wait.<//review>

<review>I’ve been going to Remington, getting tattoos from Terry since they opened at the old location. This is a 1st class shop. The artists are very clean and do a great job with customers. Some of the artists have wait times but it is well worth it to get quality work done. I can’t give them enough stars. I travel from Texas multiple times a year to get spectacular artwork.
Do your homework and look up the artists and their art. Be respectful when you contact them and they will provide you the better service than most tattoo shops across the US.
Terry Ribera is an awesome artist, I have 2 full sleeves and a chest piece from him. Highly recommended!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Remington Tattoo Parlor - My artist was Terry Ribera.

let me start off by saying, i got a tattoo cover up done by Terry.

Before even finding Terry and Remington Tattoo, i contacted SEVERAL tattoo artists to see if they could get the job done, what my options were and had many questions about the process in general.. Many emails going unresponsive - never hearing from them, or when the few artists finally did respond (took several weeks), pretty much every artist told me a cover up would not be possible and i would need to do laser removal first. No one wanted to work with me. At that point i had lost hope that this was ever going to be possible.

Then comes my experience with Terry. Frustrated and a little upset that no one wanted to work with me, i had googled something like 'best cover up tattoo artist', seeing as i need to find someone who has a lot of experience with covering tattoos. Google referred me to Remington Tattoo... i looked through Terry's portfolio, loved the art and his work, and i read that the shop specializes in things like this... so i said, ok, lets send a message. This is probably the last bit of hope i had left.

i believe it was literally 1 day later. i received a really lengthy, well composed, very informative and detailed response from Terry. Not only saying he would have no problem doing the cover up, but also went into such detail about the process. Like, deep into the technical details of why he would do XYZ when doing the cover, going into black&grey theory, etc!. I was shocked... every other artist wasn't giving me the time of day, and the various vague responses i got all told me to just laser it off first. Here comes Terry, with this extremely personal, detailed, lengthy  email message, you could immediately tell "this guy loves his job". He took time out of his day to really make me feel comfortable. i didn't hear from an assistance just telling me to come in. He took his personal time, which essentially is what won me over.

And every experience after that was just as professional and great. We met up for the consultation, pre-covid, so he can take a look at my existing tattoo. In person, he was extremely personable, it felt like i was hanging out with an old friend. He was super confident. I brought some example images i found on google for brainstorming and idea sharing. He immediately began drawing right in front of me and came up with a really wicked tattoo idea which i was extremely happy about. Went home that night feeling not like just another customer at a tattoo shop, but as if i had made a friend.

it took us 2 sessions, about 6 hours, Terry works extremely fast and efficient. He gets the ink in and gets you out there, no fooling around. i left with an awesome tattoo, that is a very unique style, and honestly, couldnt have been happier with the overall experience. I have had other tattoo's done before, and i can say, this experience was not like any other. This was the most comfortable and positive experience i have ever had in a tatttoo chair. Even after leaving, and being done, a few texts messages of Terry sharing pictures of the final product and his sincerity about having me as a client... it went a long way in my book... considering, for me, the communication was superb from the very first email, you can tell it was genuine.

the shop was extremely clean, everyone was very nice and professional, and there's really not a bad thing i could say about the shop.... well, other than the drive. I live in Orange County, and going to San Diego was a bit of a trek... but not too bad, that is not the shops fault.

10/10, would recommend Remington and Terry 100%. great experience, great vibes and i will be going back to get more when time, money  and ideas of what to do next allows... Thank you Terry.

I have hired Terry Ribera, the owner of Remington Tattoo, to do the bulk of my two full arm sleeves over the years. He is an excellent artist who listens carefully to your needs, and he plans with you in advance the artwork that you wish to have done. He is patient and thorough, and he does his best to accommodate you with his busy schedule. I will soon be going back to Terry to begin work on two calf sleeves.< /Review>

My first time here and Terry was amazing! I wanted a cover up tattoo done and Terry was so helpful from start to finish. We discussed what would work and what wouldn’t, he executed my new piece wonderfully and I am so happy with it! I highly recommend this tattoo shop, very clean and welcoming environment!<//text>

I am so in love with my tattoo from Jasmine at Remington. She has a a very light touch and her pieces are absolutely beautiful. The whole process, from booking to communication about design, to our actual session, was easy and fun. Jasmine was super  chill to hang out with while getting tattooed and the shop decor is rad! You can tell these people are legit artists who take their work very seriously. Highly recommended. Oh and they are right between North and South park! So perfect! Will be back for more.< /Text>

You can tell that she is an artist, as each piece was more awe-inspiring than what I had in my mind, when I would ask her to craft me a tattoo.
I always get asked by people if they are new, because the colors have remained so vibrant. I look forward to getting more work done by her.< /Text>< Pictures>

In one word AMAZING. In more words, this tattoo parlor as a whole has an amazing vibe as it is run out of converted home in North Park. Each artist has a unique style to fit whatever concept your heart desires.

I’ve been seeing Jasmine Worth for my tattoos for a few years now and wouldn’t go to anyone else. Her neo-traditional style is truly unique and the colors she has are vibrant. If you’re in the mood to chat she will talk to you about almost anything but if you just want to sit and feel those thousands of needles drag across your skin in silence she is cool with that too.

All in all I highly recommend Remington for your tattoo needs and wants as well as Jasmine for the tattoo of your dreams.<//text>

Got my Sleeve done about 3 years ago. Terry was great through the whole process from sketching what I wanted to tattooing me. I had looked for artist on IG and his art stood out and I'm glad that he was the artist I choose.  My arm came out great and get many compliments on it.  I actually have an appointment in a week to sketch what I want on my leg. Thanks Terry</text>

This is the most talented and professional tattoo parlor that I have ever been to. I have got a lot of work done before coming here, but now this is the only place that I will ever go to. Terry is amazing and is well worth the wait. He is extremely fast so do not be intimidated by cost because he move twice as fast sometimes 3 times faster than most artists. He completed both of my side pieces in 6 hours per side and I’m a big dude. Any artist I had before would have taken at least double that amount of time. I cannot promote this shop enough and if you are debating on getting something done from here don’t. These are real tattoo artist for people who want to get real art put on their body for the rest of their life.<//review>

<Review>Words can’t describe Terry’s talent and professional as a tattoo artist. I have gone to see Terry for two full sleeve tattoos over the course of a couple years. My most recent sleeve was just finished up a couple months ago and I love it. So many compliments on both sleeves that Terry has done. Even though Terry’s schedule is super booked and busy , he always worked with me and my schedule ( last minute time changes etc). He came in early numerous occasions to accommodate my needs. There is a reason why Terry is booked about a year out, he is the best tattoo artist , PERIOD!! Seriously , if you want a badass tattoo by a badass artist , call Terry. He is well worth the wait! I will be going back for more in the future. Thanks Terry.< /Review>< Pictures>

Terry, the owner is awesome. His tattoos are works of art. I have two, both on my ankles. I let him do his artistry after telling him want I wanted. I get numerous  compliments. He did my first one in 2011 & my last one, a full bodied fairy just two months ago. If you want a beautiful tattoo, that is a work of art, GO TO HIM! Thanks Terry, you are wonderful!!  New update, went to Terry just a little over a month ago, just had to get one more tattoo. It is so beautiful. Terry does such wonderful work. He does tattoos in a very sterile manner, so that is never an issue. You want the best, go to Terry at Remington Tattoo Parlor!<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I got the honor and privilege to get my first tattoo with Terry Ribera.  I went with a biomechanical sleeve.  I didn’t know what to expect but, I was pleasantly surprised.  Terry is very professional and easy to talk to.  I didn’t know exactly what I wanted, but I told him what I liked and he just started sketching away on paper.  I was blown away at his thought process and how it all just came together.  The man is a true artist, which is evident by just sitting in the shop.  It’s like an actual art gallery with a lot of throwback memorabilia and his own paintings and artwork.  I am beyond stoked about my sleeve and have already scheduled for my next one!  The wait is about 10-12 months, but if you see his work, you’ll know why!</review>< pics>

Let me start off by saying that this has been the most professional, clean and talented tattoo Experience I have been apart of. I was personally tattooed by the shop owner terry and he exceeded all my expectations. I contacted him via email and was responded to promptly.  We worked TOGETHER on my art work and he did a diligent job to make sure I was happy and comfortable with all my art work.  He has a light hand and made the tattooing experience a bearable one (tats are painful it’s part of the process) but he definitely made it an easier experience.  The prices at this shop are not at the low end so if your looking for a cheap deal this place isn’t it. But if you are looking for a real peace of artwork That will literally blow your mind away than this is the place to be. I will definitely be recommending remmington tattoo to all of my friends and family!!</text>

<review>Terry Ribera is a god among mortal men. He took two arms and a quarter of a back that were already heavily tatted and he designed me a gorgeous cover up that finally captured the story I wanted to tell.

It’s beautiful. The colors still pop a year later. And I get stopped everywhere as people compliment these artful arms.

Not only is the end result great, but his genuine company wasn’t too shabby either. I literally spent 4 hours with Terry every other week for a year and I always looked forward to catching up with him and talking about the dystopian future that awaits humanity. 😂

Seriously, I wouldn’t go anywhere else. I found the only artist I’ll ever need in this guy. 🙌</review>< username>

Terry and his crew are the most dedicated, hard working, and professional artists around. Working on a half sleeve with Terry and he has been so friendly, informative, and collaborative with my ideas and designs. I understand why all the artists are in demand. The shop itself is clean, comfortable and really home like. I LOVE my experience there. You will too!</Review>

<text>A review should be compelling and convincing enough to lend a significant “word of mouth” draw for someone else to gravitate towards a certain business or entity. Hopefully with this review I accomplish that. Word of mouth is exactly how I was drawn to Remington Tattoo Parlor, specifically Terry. I knew someone who had a full back piece drawn and applied by Terry and was finally ready to get one myself after several years of debating. I contacted Terry via email back in December 2018 to set up a consultation for March 2019. I anticipated full well ahead of time Terry would be a busy artist with appointments booked well in advance throughout the year for large pieces but I knew any wait would be worth it. I brought with me a mere concept in mind to commemorate 10 years since a significant incident happened in my life. As Terry began to draw from scratch and bring my concept to life I knew I was in the right place. The draft of what would eventually morph later into a final product was drawn that day and I had full confidence Terry would later execute the full piece with expert precision. Now I just had to wait until July 2019 for my 1st appointment. As the days drew near Terry completed the final drawing, which I received via email, and I was both blown away and excited to begin. Six sessions later between July and October 2019 , consisting of between 2-3 hours each, and I was proud to display a full Terry Ribera original piece of art. A minor 15-min touch up session at the end of November followed and I again knew I had chosen the right artist. Terry’s vision for every piece he executes is second to none. Despite the (minor) pain I knew each session would entail I so looked forward to them and looking back cannot help but laugh at remembering some of the interesting conversations we had. Terry is just an all around excellent human being and I was lucky to have been able to work with him. The overall atmosphere of the shop was fantastic during each session as everyone was very friendly, professional and just great to be around. I would not hesitate to recommend either Terry or another artist at Remington based on my experiences. I have worked with various people over the years for smaller tattoo pieces I have. But with anything Terry suggested for my piece I merely replied, “I trust you.” I hope my described experience has been compelling enough to put your full trust in either Terry or his fellow artists at Remington for whatever piece you choose, large or small. Because after all is said and done you have to be proud of the piece you were given and I can full well say I am proud to display mine.< /text><rating>5< /rating><gmap_id>0x80d9548b3c791845:0x85e948e60efc0d40< /gmap_id>< user>

<review>Best Tattoo Shop in San Diego

I can proudly say the only tattoo artist that has ever touched my body is Terry Ribera.

Terry did my left arm over the course of about 3 months. We worked together to come up with something I am more than proud to have on me. Everything was very professionally handled from appointment setting, consultation, artwork and the actual tattooing process.

While in the process I also got a chance to talk to and know the other artists at the shop. Every artist at Remington each have a unique passion for art - which is important for me, it tells me they are not fake or just doing it because its the tattoo thing. They actually care about what they do and have a passion for doing it.

Check them out, you won't be disappointed.</review><Rate>5</Rate>< resp>

You can't go wrong at this shop for tattoos - and remember that some artist do have a waiting list - so be prepared to plan ahead. Love this shop and it's the only place I will get tattooed. ... period.</text>

I have been coming to this shop ever since Alessio has been at Remington. Alessio has been my go to for tattoos ever since I got my first one. He is very professional and is super clean when it comes to designs and quality. I’ve never had any issues with healing or shading or lines of any sort. No complaints and I recommend Alessio to anyone. I have also gotten a couple tattoos from a couple artists who are now at Remington and they are top notch. Remington is the place to be at!< /Text>

<review>As an artist, it is refreshing to sit down and watch another artist draw an original price of art based on your ideas, not just copy and pasting clip art on an iPad.  This is what you get when you sit down with an artist at Remington, a comfortable setting where all the artists are friendly, professional, and super talented.<//review>< pics>

Walked in a year and a half ago and told Brad what I wanted.  At first, he said it couldn't be done due to the time constraints (I was leaving the country within a months time).  I set the appointment anyway and when I came back in, to my surprise, he said he was able to do what I asked.  I let him do his thing and was blown away.  I went back 9 months later, as I was visiting and had him do a custom piece, and was again, blown away.

The fact that he had done some research on the Koala, to get it just right was awesome.  I've seen everyone's work there and they're all great at their craft!  I've seen Terry doing big body pieces and the other's doing work as well.  Amazing place.

I also like that every time that I walk into Remington, the artists are working on another piece, or sketching or painting; really honing their craft as tattoo artists.  It says a lot.

They even recommended some artists out here in the Netherlands, and now I've got some more ink my body thanks to the awesome recommendation.   Super legit tattoo studio!</text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I cannot overstate the professionalism of the staff, the cleanliness of the shop, and the quality of the work done at Remington. I had work done by Nathaniel Gann, who was very welcoming and worked with my ideas to create a piece of exceptional quality. The tattoo far surpassed my expectations and any doubts I had about tattoos were thrown out the window. If (or when) I decide on another tattoo I would without question return to Nathaniel Gann and Remington.< /Text>< pictures>

Total jerk on the phone.

He disrespected a Chief Arson Investigator with 22 years Fire Service.

Wounded in the Line of Duty, couldn't answer a simple question for me,

then kept saying, " for the third time I'm telling you"...

Well excuse me for not knowing the process.

I've never had a tattoo and was advised by their ad on the internet...

"Call Us, we'll take your questions on the phone".

Liar and Idiot.< /review>

RUN DON’T WALK!!! Update:
Came back for a second round, not hot this time, less people. Amazing food here, this is what you are looking for!
Original review,
Rolled into town with a big hunger. Door advertised “Air Conditioned” we knew what that would mean, it’s gonna be hot AF! We were not disappointed, it was. Sat next to the kitchen so it was even hotter but we got to watch the masters at work. A few ice cold Tsingtao helped a lot. Ordered Spicy dumplings, Chive and Pork, and Chicken. The Spicy had a peanut butter sauce, they were so-so. The Chive and Pork were excellent. Also ordered Mongolian Beef, excellent but not spicy enough. Finally we found what we came for, the steamed “buns” with pork and soup inside, they are very hot and pop in your mouth. They are #1 on the menu, if you come here and do not order them, kick yourself in the face right now!  Hot or not, AC or heater on full-blast, we will be back. This place is so good you feel bad not taking all your family and friends to show them what’s up. Enjoy!<//review>

Came to Panda Dumpling for the first time after a friend recommended it to me. We got seated and served very quickly, also the staff was friendly and helped us order our meal. We went all out here and ordered the hot and sour soup, pot stickers, xiao long boa, and the porcupine dumplings. Everything was so delicious! Also it was priced very reasonably. Our meals were so good that we almost finished all of them and left very happy. I highly recommend Panda Dumpling!<//text>

<text>The food was okay, at least for Bay Area standards. The best dish was the fried salt and pepper fish, although it was a bit soggy from sitting in the to go box. The taste of the food was average. However, the portions were pretty generous.

The hot sauce they gave us wasn't spicy, just tasted like oil!< /text></record></dataset><record>

It was so hot in here omg. The kitchen is set on the side of the building and not behind. So the heat from the kitchen goes all into the restaurant. The AC, fans, and open door could not stop us from steaming inside. It wasn't crowded, but a lot of people seemed to order to-go instead of eating inside.

The food, however, was very tasty. We ordered sweet and sour fish, shanghai stir fried noodles, xiao long bao, pan fried pork buns, tofu clay pot, and rice cake with peanuts for dessert. The food came very fast and was really hot.

Prices were fair and the portions were pretty good. We probably would not eat inside, but ordering to-go from here would be good.< /text>

I went to this restaurant with a few coworkers for lunch. I was really excited to try it because I have heard so many great things about it.

I was not disappointed. The food was fantastic, but what I enjoyed most was the Husband and Wife who run the place. They are hilarious and very kind. I want to go back mainly to see them again.

The only food item that I didn't like was the Spicy Dumplings. They had such a strong flavor of peanut butter. It was too much for me. I loved everything else though.<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Fantastic Taiwanese food! Every time I get an order of Xiaolongbao and burn my mouth because I can't wait for the soup to cool down. Ever wonder how they make those perfect little pinches in the seam? Poke your head in the tiny kitchen and no doubt you'll see a fresh batch being made.

I could get by on simply a plate of their thick and chewy wheat noodles but they deserve five stars for plenty of vegetables in every dish. Found on a nondescript street this restaurant is well worth an hours drive.</review>< pics>

<Text>We came here because our go to place (Little Shanghai) was closed. We ordered the same dishes we normally do and quality was lower. The pea sprouts needed a bit more garlic, spicy wonton looked very - or at least the sauce. XLB an fried rice were ok. Prices and portions were reasonable. Won't return here unfortunately.<//Text>< resp>

My first time going here was great. The staff and food were incredible. A family member recommended the place and what dishes to get. The food was so great that it made my other family member eat spicy Curry Chicken. I also got Xiao Long Bao dumplings that warmed me to the core; can’t wait to return here.<//text>

Came back here just for the leek boxes. They are huge here and so good. Very thin dough, filling has vermicelli and little shrimp.

Haven't been here in a while but will need to come back again soon :)</Review>

It may close their business soon.
My dumplings was soft.
I did not mind if they could not cook what I wanted.

They charged 1 dollar to change menu

BUT IT WAS NOT what I wanted.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Service is horrible. We called in to make the order. They assumed it was to go. When we sat down to eat they tried to tell us to leave (the place was fairly empty) but then begrudgingly let us eat. Food itself was average.<//Text>< Response>

Very good food. Chicken dumplings are perfect. Fast service, our order was ready in about 10-15 minutes. Prices are reasonable. Place is not very large, about 10 tables. They offer takeout as well as eating inside. They accept credit cards, but minimum payment is $10. Discover is not accepted. There are many parking spots on the street, but not sure how busy this street at lunch time.<//text>

Would not even give this place one star!  The kitchen is dirty...just take a walk to their one restroom and you will see. We got the shimp and pork dumplings  and they were average, nothing special.  We were charged 1.50 for each bowl of rice and the waitress  didnt even tell us- it just showed up on our bill. Will not go back.</Text>

The dumplings are delicious. I wish the menu had description of what the ingredients are in each dishes. Because we ordered their Spicy Dumplings and it had peanut sauce on it, I wasn't expecting that 🥴 I thought it was going to be dumplings soaking in spicy oil like other restaurants. But I guess I just assumed, but when service is not that friendly who would want to ask? And when I asked them if it was the right dish that we got, the man didn't even come to our table. He just said yes that it is 😑 ANYWAY we ate it anyway because I was HANGRY! Sonif you are unsure ask them while they are taking your order.<//text>

<Review>This is a bustling little place in the traditional, low-key Chinese style, complete with a brisk take-out business (possibly even bigger than their dine-in crowd). This is first and foremost a dumpling place; their Xiao Long Bao (soup-filled dumplings) get top billing on the menu and are fantastic, but bring some friends so you can try a few different dumplings. Family-friendly, quick service. If you're taking out, then call in your order so you don't have to wait as long.</Review>< pics>

I love this place for it's food and it's homey atmosphere. I brought my coworker here after work because he was so sick and miserable. I got him some wonton soup and he perked up after 10 min. This is now our favorite spot to go even after 3 years because it feels like a home-cooked meal after a hard day. I highly recommend the sesame dumplings with soup for desert. It is a simple dish but the texture of the dumpling never fails to make me smile and the xiao long bao has never failed to warm me to the core.<//Text>

Food is very good and flavorful.  Would have given them a Five but have been going back there for several years and have noticed that the portion quantities are a tad smaller than they have been in the past for my favorite salt and pepper fish dish.  Their prices are fair for the area that they are in.</Review>

<Name>Shirley Park<//Name><rating>5<//rating><Text>Panda Dumpling is a hole in the wall in San Carlos. Great dumplings, of course. Come here before it's discovered and is ruined with long lines.

The service is fast, and there are never any problems waiting for food to arrive. Everything is casual at Panda Dumpling, which makes it great for a quick bite to eat after work or a weekend lunch.

The Xiaolongbao is probably the best thing on the menu.<//Text><user_id>114347320449720201091</user_id></record>

OH MY GOSH! THIS FOOD IS AMAZING!!!! We ordered shrimp dumplings, pan fried pork buns, pork dumplings with bok choy, cucumber salad, and braised string beans for takeout. It legitimately tasted like my trip to China, where I gorged on dumplings and ate them everyday.. My tummy is so happy. Everything was fresh and VERY well seasoned. Very polite service with speedy checkout! Can't wait to come back!<//Text>

Their Xiao Long Bao is well made, very tasty and juicy. This is a good sign, since Xiao Long Bao is an indicator for the rest of the dishes at a restaurant like this, and this is very much the case here.</review>

<text>Food is good, try the dumplings that come in a peanut sauce. Xlb is better than at most other places.
Service feels a bit rushed if you go for dinner after 8. They're supposed to be open till 9, but tend to rush you out of there a bit after 8:30.<//text><user>101154875155526524347<//user></record>

< Review>
One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in bay area. I usually get the Chicken Fried Rice and Salt Pepper Fish Filet, which might not exactly be your typical Chinese dish, but I generally like them and this restaurant is easily the best ones I've had. The service is generally pretty quick and the place is pretty clean for a moderately priced Chinese restaurant.</Review>

On the outside, this is a place you would probably pass without a second thought. On the inside, its heaven in your mouth. Obviously(?) this place is known for its dumplings. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend the spicy ones-  I think they may be made with peanut butter? The portion sizes are huge (a bowl of soup will easily serve a group of 4). Other parts of their menu are good as well. Expect a wait for your food- it tends to take a while to get served after ordering.<//text>

I always order their crab and pork XLB, which are always hot and delicious, even when I order to-go.  The normal pork ones are pretty good too, but not as special. Having the crab really enhances the flavor, making them the best I've found in the area. I like it with the vinegar sauce (which you have to ask for, esp if it's to-go), but it pairs really well together. I could totally eat at least two orders by myself!

The only con: they don't deliver. I'd probably order them 2-3x as much if they delivered. But, it's totally worth calling in and getting it to-go!</text>

<review>The free kimchi is what stood out most here. I had to have it refilled within minutes of arriving. It had the perfect balance of spice, sweet and fermented fish flavor. Yum!
Their xlb was very savory with full pork belly flavor which might make it a favorite to others but not me.
The spicy dumplings are not so spicy but their peanut flavor makes them a tasty comfort food.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>They have hedgehog buns here! That, by itself, should warrant a 5-star review.

But seriously, everything else here is delicious as well.

I highly recommend their delicious xiao long bao, steamed dumplings, and green onion pancakes! They're excellent comfort food, and you can never go wrong with order them.</Review><username>Nathan Yang<//username>< GmapID>

< Review>
Mushroom and bok choy stir fry was way too salty.
The shrimp dumpling mixed with pork were wrapped in thicker dumping dough.
The chicken fried rice was just so so, the rice clearly needed more time. Because they were to moist for friend rice that day.
Maybe I will try some other options from them next time. But with what I ordered, I was not pleased.<//Review>

<Review>Sorry about my review, but I was totally disappointed. I rely alot on the star rating and of course customer reviews. We order quite a bit of food...garlic chicken, spicy sesame noodle with pork chop ( the peanut butter ruined it), combination fried rice, pot stickers, crab dumplings which actually was the only decent thing we ate, steamed pork buns, sweet and sour pork this just to name a few. Spent over $100 with my entire family. Just really wish you live up to your star ratings. Maybe we just ordered the wrong foods??? We won't be returning.

<text>After I told a coworker about my new addiction to dumplings and dim sum, she recommended I come check this place out. Some people might be put off by how close in name this restaurant is to a Chinese fast food chain, but don't let that turn you off! I stopped by for lunch with my girlfriend and we fell in love during our first visit and try to stop by here at least once a month to get some tasty dumplings and dim sum.

If you're getting dumplings, go with the freshly handmade crab/pork soup dumplings (xiaolongbao) and skip over their other dumplings that are frozen. The soup dumplings are absolutely delicious. They come out piping hot, so give it a minute, then get the dumpling in your mouth, close your eyes, and prepare to bite down and release an amazing mixture of broth, pork, and crab! Yum!

Some of my other favorite items on the menu include their tasty chive pancakes which are empanada-like in structure. Lightly fried to perfection, they're filled with scrambled egg, chives, and rice noodle. You basically get two "empanadas" cut in half so this can comfortably feed four. Their pork buns are savory and are not filled with the traditional sweet pork you normally get in steamed buns, but they are great nonetheless. Their spicy wontons are also great - actually pretty spicy and drenched in a thick peanut sauce.

They also do entree dishes, but we haven't explored that side of the menu very thoroughly though we did get an eggplant entree once which we both enjoyed!

The decor isn't anything to brag about but the restaurant is clean and the staff has always been friendly and attentive during our many visits.

The absolute worst part about eating here is we have both honed in on our absolutely favorite items leaving very little room to experiment. Fortunately, we've realized that bringing along family and friends gives us more mouths to feed and more opportunity to explore their menu!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I've been furnishing the homes I sell & remodel with furniture from Best Buy Furniture for about 7 months now. They're always great, they're always friendly, they always care. Never have I ever had a bad experience with them. Even when we've encountered dalays or bumps on the road, they figure out a way to help me & make me a happy customer. Not to mention they have amazing prices, beautiful pieces & great quality. I will continue coming back for all my furniture needs. The owner, Andrea & the other young lady are all great.< /Text><userid>110946516163375704437<//userid><Gmap_id>0x80ea41048aa63305:0xff376c428d67ef3f<//Gmap_id>< Response>

The buying process was simple but the customer service trying to find out when our furniture would be ready to pick up was a nightmare. I was told it would be available the next day then when I would call to verify a pick up time it was always delayed for one reason or another. Picking up from their warehouse was an absolute nightmare,the people were extremely rude, we weren't allowed to even see what we purchased before paying off the balance. The employee wouldn't even help my husband load the furniture because he wanted to open the box to make sure it was correct.</text>

Came in just to look around after shopping around town for the past few weeks and was happy with the customer service. Adam took the time to show us around and explain things to me. Walked out happy and satisfied with my purchase. It’s not about the price sometimes it’s about the customer service he cares about his customers and his job he showed he’s not just here for a paycheck.< /review>

Wish I could give this place 0 stars, because it doesn’t even deserve half. I only went to this place because my friend worked here, I placed my order since February, it’s now almost November and I never got my complete order, after months and months of waiting I finally got a refund. I was always given the run around by Adam, making promises up and down that I would have my order, that he would call me back, ask me did i ever get either of those things? Absolutely not. Not only did I not get my entire order, I didn’t even get the correct sectional I wanted, and yes I have proof of messages with pictures of what exactly I wanted, and even then I never complained and still I couldn’t even be bothered to get a call by Adam. I will make sure everyone I know never goes to this place, and by the way he also owns Impress Vanity’s in the mall so I urge you to please think twice before you spend your money on this place. Don’t give it to someone who doesn’t value the people who keep his business running.</Text>

Update

Jessica from the warehouse contacted me a few days after I left the review. She was kind and apologized. She also explained that the guy who delivered my furniture would be reprimanded accordingly. She also explained the store was willing to give me a discount should I choose to purchase from them again. Jessica's apology and kindness felt genuine and I will consider returning to best buy.

This is a long one...I purchased my furniture back in September. I ordered a bedroom set and couches. I was told it would take 5-6 weeks. I was understanding of that. I got a call in October letting me know that my couches were delayed even more. Again, I was understanding, and they let me know they would give me a call in a week and half. After two weeks with no calls I called the store where Andrea asked me to come in and meet with the manager due to my bedroom set not being available. I went down to the store where the manager let me know my invoice had been lost. My bedroom set was nowhere to be found and he offered a bedroom set on the floor that would be delivered the next day (Wednesday) with set up included. The bedroom set was delivered Thursday because the warehouse didn't have any queen mattresses. No one ever called me, I had to contact the store multiple times to get an update. I asked about my couches while at the store and the manager stated they would be delivered in a week, he contacted delivery and they confirmed they were on their way to the warehouse. He told me he would personally follow up. A week later I got no calls, I called the store multiple times where I was placed on hold for 20 minutes or told I would get a call back and never did. Finally I was able to speak with Andrea who remembered me, she was able to get me information and was kind and apologetic and was able to get my couches to me before Thanksgiving. Now when my couches were finally delivered, I was told they would be delivered between 1-6 and they showed up at 6:30pm with no call letting me know they were on their way or running late. The gentlemen who delivered the couches were another issue. It was my understanding the couches were to be set up too. One gentleman showed me my invoice and stated "it only say's drop off". I clarified and stated because I had been waiting since September they offered free set-up. Now there may have been some miscommunication with the set-up I will admit that, but the delivery guy then proceeded to offer to set up my couches for $80 stating the store would have charged me double and he was giving me a "good deal” I told him no and he seemed to get offended telling me he was “just trying to help me out” and “was off the clock anyways”.  This particular gentleman was very off putting and had I actually paid for set-up I'm not sure I would have felt comfortable with him in my home.

As for the furniture itself, it’s cheap. I guess you get what you pay for, I had to build the couches and it was missing a couple washers. I was going to call the store and let them know all the details but after seeing other reviews figured there was no point and am better off warning potential customers. Andrea was the only one who seemed to care and the rest of the store maybe had no idea or just didn’t want to deal. I understand there is a lot going on but throughout the whole process, I received maybe two phone calls with updates. Like other have said, I suggest thinking twice before heading here.< /Text>

< Review>
At first,  Adam was very accommodating and sent me pictures of his catalogue based on the description of what I was looking for. He sent me many pictures until I was satisfied and made my purchase fast and easy. Very few businesses catered to this request so I am grateful, but fast forward 4 months later... I paid for my bed in full and still have not gotten the complete order. I have made several attempts over the phone and even in person to correct this and all the employees and Adam say they will fix the problem, but they are just giving me the run around. They don't call me back and it is hard to get a hold of them. They appear friendly, but are inefficient and dishonest. Don't order from here if you need it delivered or it isn't available day of. Something is wrong with their warehouse or delivery system. I don't think it is fair that I have to pay for an incomplete bed. I suggest reading all reviews as it looks like many others have the same problem.< /Review>

<text>It’s so unfortunate that I have to write this review. Adam has always treated us with respect and able to help us at all times. We have bought a dining table from here. We were interested these past two times on buying couches from Best Buy Furniture. There is a younger gal that works there with the worst attitude ever. I believe there are two ladies that work there and clearly you can tell as soon as you walk in who the one with the attitude is. She bosses the other employee around, she speaks Spanish thinking we will not understand, and she is so disrespectful to her co workers and especially the customers. I didn’t catch her name both times and honestly I just wanted to leave ASAP because I was so upset and I know Adam doesn’t run a business like this. Especially right now during these hard times, customer service is everything. I hope some disciplinary action takes place.</text><rate>1< /rate>< Pictures>

<review>Purchased vanity two months ago was told it would take two weeks and they tell me they ordered the wrong desk so they recommended I pay the difference for the desk they messed up on. When I tell them if they could just let me keep that desk since I keep being told to pick up at the warehouse only to be told at the warehouse “next week”. Good luck getting in contact with a supervisor or manager they won’t call you back and have workers give you the bad news and unwilling to have any sort of customer service don’t fall for the fake 5 star reviews and look at yelp wish I would’ve< /review><user>106197122620254640844< /user><Response>None< /Response>< user_name>

The girl at the front desk was on the phone talking about her personal business and cussing right in front of us. Both employees were on separate personal phone calls and had their feet up. They never moved from their seats or even offered to help. I would never recommend anyone to shop there.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Purchased a bed set , the lady at the front desk said it would arrive in 2 weeks. They even told me a set date on when they would deliver my furniture, that day I had the room ready for the arrival of the bed set, I called to make sure and they mentioned they had a confusion with another order so mine wasn’t ready. it has been a month and still no news. On top of that I paid a fee for the set up and delivery, when I called to check up when the bed set would be arriving since it has now been a month, she said it would arrive in another day ready for pick up when I PAID for DELIVERY AND SET UP. I told her I paid for delivery and set up and she then mentioned it would be delivered the next day. I waited another day and called to confirm but she still mentioned it was not confirmed that my delivery would arrive today but maybe in ANOTHER day , definitely had a horrible experience. Plus, I’m still waiting on my bed set till this day. Mind you I paid more than $1000 for this set.  Still waiting.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

This place is amazing! I go here for all of my furniture needs, The customer service is amazing, Brenda and Adam are the best, they always provide the best deals. I walked in to look around and came out with an entire bedroom set plus delivery included!! I literally recommend Best Buy furniture to all of my friends and family. I will never buy furniture anywhere else, their quality is amazing and you can’t beat the price anywhere else. Thank you Brenda & Adam 😊<//review>

It’s a small place and limited stuff when you go to the shop. You have to look into their catalogue to see more and ask the front desk about the prices. The lady whos in the front desk seems busy taking in calls and complaints. When I went there to ask her she just ask what’s the code for the one that we liked and then ignored us after. So we just walk out and she seems rude and not accommodating.</Text>

All I got to say go somewhere else....its been over a month and I started making payments on a bedroom set I dont have when I try calling them they don't pick up phones i can't leave messages because its not set up...when I finally got ahold of a person she was rude and said I dont know what happened it was supposed  to be delivered  weeks ago so I asked so can u deliver Sunday or Monday she said no maybe Thursday or Friday after 4pm so I'm suppose to just wait for 2 days on when she decides it B.S.

I purchased a set of dressers and was told it was going to take 2-3 weeks. Didnt arrive until a month later but was only able to pick up half of my order. Didnt get originally what I purchased. Had to keep going back to see if it was ready and each time I went they gave me a different excuse in why it wasnt in the warehous such as new employees (same excuse they had given my sister a month before) they were organizing the warehouse, the warehouse was a mess. I was fed up with all the excuses. Each time I went they "supposedly" had to reorder my dressers and last it's been over 2 months and I'm still missing pieces from my purchase. Will never go back to this furniture they are a mess and completely liars!</Review>

My wife is retiring from teaching in June after 40 years. We decided to celebrate at Maui in October. We were told we can rent equipment for snorkeling, but I felt uncomfortable during these times using the equipment. I went online, discovered Scuba.com. I purchased masks, snorkels and fins for reasonable prices. Everything has been delivered on time has exceeded our expectations. Great prices, timely delivery and fantastic communication.

Dave was super helpful with great customer service!   Very friendly and reassured all the customers that he would be right with them; not leaving anyone unnoticed.  Got us our answers and equipment quickly and efficiently. Great prices and deals with scuba gear!  Got to order online for a great deal, then come to the store and exchange for the items that we ordered the wrong sizes-hassle free! Would highly recommend!</text>

Great easy fast service! I already paid my cart and saw another item I wanted. I contacted workers and even though it was off hours, they sent me a rapid response saying they could combine everything. Arthur was very professional and helpful. I have ordered from scuba before and even drove to the building to pick up items. Always fast and friendly service. The workers definitely know their stuff! Thanks again! I love this company!<//Text>

I was in a bind and needed a suit fast- I ordered the wrong size. Darrick was prompt and professional in sending out a new suit as I returned the other. All in one short, fast service-oriented call.<//review>

<Review>Arthur, I sent you a separate email.  Thanks.

Shared this on Yelp as well.

First, I want to start by saying I do not like giving negative feedback.  I think everyone has had bad days!  But I would expect a company to keep their promises and commitments and if they can't that they come up with a creative solution.

I have never had a problem with scuba.com when it was owned by the former owner, and I have never had problems with their, now, sister company Leisurepro.  They are now both owned by Adorama.  I have spent literally over $4,000 over the last 8 months with scuba.com and it is my most recent purchase that has caused me to write this review.  I share the amount I have spent, no to brag, but to put into context that I did a lot of business with scuba.com

My last (and final) purchase from scuba.com was a steel HP80 that had to be shipped from their sister store back in New Jersey.  This was right before the COVID-19 thing happened.  I was going to pick it up at the store but because the store was closed, I had directed UPS that I would pick up the tank directly from UPS's OC hub (UPS tried to deliver twice to their store but could not deliver it, so I was trying to be empathetic and not have UPS have to ship it back to Leisurepro and then for Leisurepro to accrue additional freight to ship it back to me).  This was in March.

Part of the purchase of the tank was they would assemble the tank, do the VIP, and fill the tank.

When I called their customer service at the beginning of the week (6/22), I was told that their new location in Costa Mesa would not be open till August.  Well, I would like to go diving and would love to use my new tank to do so, and really do not want to wait till August!  So I called again today (6/25) and wanted to know if I could take the tank to another LDS which was open to do the VIP, assembly, and air fill, and if scuba.com could credit the $15 to my account.

The instructor first did not understand what I was talking about, and after some clarification on my end, he offered to put it together but that they could not fill the tank as their new location did not have a compressor.  I again asked if I could go and get the thing done by another LDS and have them credit my account.  Which the instructor just repeated what he told me before.  Also, he noted that the tank should have a "red shark" label on it indicating that the tank had VIP.  I told him that I had not even opened the box so did not know if it did have the label.  Well, after the call I did open the box and the tank did not have a Red Shark label on it, so I guess it did not have a VIP.

I got frustrated and told him that he had lost my business for good and that I would not do any more business with scuba.com.

I wish the company well, and I realize that my experience may not be the same experience others will go through.  But I thought I would share my experience.  Thanks for reading this lengthy review!!!</Review><Response>{'time': 1593186666750, 'text': "Good morning Bob, These reviews (even if not the best) are learning and growing experiences on what may be wrong or what's working great and truly appreciate all of them.

<Text>Just finished a chat with instructor Dave.  I am looking at purchasing a new BC.  I have several years of experience, and know mostly what I am looking for.  Dave was extremely helpful, and gave me several options to look at.  He was very knowledgeable,  and was east to deal with.  I live close, so I am going to go their store front, and look at the choices.  Hoping to meet him while I am there.  Thanks again Dave.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dcdebc3405cae9:0x598ac1c83a388513</GmapID><pictures>None</pictures><time>1551316381198</time>< username>

Quick and easy to get the correct information for sizing and product type.  Not everyone is built the same and locating the sizing chart and correct size on the website was weirdly difficult and vague.  Customer assistance was a great help and well worth the small effort it took to get the right information for me.    Live the adventure!   Happy New Year!</text>

As a first time buyer of a wetsuit, this company has totally made a great first experience for me! Tom, the instructor who helped me with customer service, was literally the coolest guy I’ve ever had the pleasure of buying something from. He was helpful, quick, and really took the time to help me pick something that was absolutely right for me. I own my own business and I know there are plenty out there who do not give customer satisfaction a second thought, and Tom went above and beyond my expectations! He was polite on the phone and answered any questions I had. I recommend buying from them 1000x over and they will be the only place I call in the future! Thanks so much!< /Text>

Arthur worked iwth me and dug through numerous options trying to find an appropriate wetsuit for both of my sons.

There are times you call companies and you're just another number. Not with this company! Tom,  in particular, provided exceptional customer service going above and beyond. Not only did he follow up with a phone call letting me know it was taking longer than he expected to hear back from the manufacturer, but he then continually kept me informed about the availability of the product and the estimated delivery date once the manufacturer got back to him. Tom - thank you for actually caring and for your time! This means more to me than you know.< /Review>

My experience with this company will keep me coming back! Ordered my husband a wetsuit, arriving quicker than anticipated, just in time for his birthday.  I have decided to buy myself a new wetsuit, too and as I searched online, I had some questions... had the pleasure of chatting with Dave via online chat and I was very very impressed! Quick response and very helpful! You guys deserve more than 5 stars. Thank you, Dave!</text>

The reviews were spot on !!! Great customer service...Darrick answered all my questions and made some very good suggestions about fins. I am a newbie to Scuba and all the stuff you find on the internet is so confusing and overwhelming. So being able to chat with someone who's been there and done that is great...Thank Darrick..< /review>

Talked to Darrick and he was a great help! I was able to order a Bare 7mm evoke wet suit at a great price. They are always helpful when I go to the showroom. Dave helped me last time I was in the shop and showed me 4 different computers and was knowledgeable about the difference in them. Defiantly looking forward to buying more in the future!</text>

Scuba.com has a big selection, almost all sizes, including hard to fit ones, and good prices.    You can chat with instructors who are knowledgeable about the product line and can steer you to the right product right away.    They know what will fit and what won't fit.  They are helpful while succinct, to provide the needed information without fluff or clutter -- similar to how communications should be while diving or performing critical technical tasks where people's lives hang in the balance.< /Review>

<text>I dropped by to check out snorkel equipment for a family reunion Hawaii trip and was thoroughly impressed with the customer service.  Miguel brought out multiple masks for me to try on and provided great advice on proper fit etc.  I understand that I am not the target audience and was blown away by how helpful and patient Miguel was.  I also appreciated that Miguel explained the benefits of better masks but did not try to upsell me on products above my needs.  I purchased equipment for my family and will refer my extended family as well.  Thanks!</text>< Resp>

All I can say wow!  I spoke to Tom for help with some snorkeling equipment and you just don't get this level of excellent service from most retailers.  Tom helped me put together a nice snorkeling package for my son in law that was well priced and quality gear.  Very impressed and will not hesitate to recommend these folks to others as well as using them for any of my scuba/snorkeling equipment needs in the future.</Review>

Easy to browse, try on and purchase products right from their warehouse in Irvine. Although it was a little confusing at first because there wasn't anyone up front; you just follow signs to the self-help laptops. Makes sense though because this location is mainly a warehouse to ship all their online orders.< /review>

I  just ordered a Henderson wet skin online. I read reviews &   Referred  to sizing chart. All were well defined & detailed. This place looks good & I ordered.   I am going to dive Cozumel spring break.  Within five minutes I got a call from Derek telling me they were out of my size in that particular suit, he suggested another letting me know it was less expensive and would be here on time for my trip.  WOW....talk about perfect response time & customer service.   I am impressed!  I don’t have my suit yet, he told me it would be here in 4 days. If it fits I’m not shopping anywhere else.  I’m excited!< /text>

My mask arrived today.  Thank  you very much!  Thanks to  Dave for installing the -3.5 corrected lenses.  I can see clearly through the mask and am excited about diving on the Great Barrier Reef in Cairns, Australia and using them for years of beautiful snorkeling. Thanks again for your attention to detail and making the extra effort to get them to me before our departure date.  Jon< /Review>

I was in the market for a 5 mm full wet suit. The one that I had wanted was on back order and would not arrive in time from my trip. Dave was very helpful in assisting me to find an alternative and in comparing the pros and cons of each. I was impressed by his knowledge and expertise in this area. I received the wetsuit quickly and it was just what I needed.<//text>

<review>Dive Instructor Dave was VERY helpful.  I had selected some snorkeling gear but I wasn't 100% sure that it was exactly what I needed based on where I was going to be snorkling.  Not only did Dave confirm my choices, he further indicated that I had planned to purchase a higher quality fin, which he would have recommended anyway.  He also helped me understand my eye Rx so that I could order the right lenses for my new mask.  Additionally, he helped build a set for under $100 for our rental guests to use so that they would have a great experience.

Well done, Dave.  Dive on!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Just getting ready to become a new diver and had a few questions to purchase some of my gear. I joined the online chat and chatted with dive instructor Dave. Was interested in a couple different BCs and after chatting unlike most sales people he suggested the cheapest of the 2 models. For reasons other than just to make a sale. It was more of a slim line construction and would be more comfortable and all that I needed for my diving needs. Thank you Dave and will be making several more orders from you!</review>

<text>I ordered 2 Lycra jumpsuits.I live in Canada and they arrived fairly quickly. It would have been sooner if it wasn't for Canada Customs. They do their best to screw things up by holding parcels, much longer than is necessary. But Scuba were very accommodating and apologized for the delay, even though they had no control over it. The suits and the service were fabulous. Thank you.<//text>< rating>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>I have been so impressed with the quality of the items I have purchased and the price. The delivery is quick and arrives well packaged. The staff that work with me are always responsive and professional. I usually use chat, and Dive Instructor Arthur is always kind, knowledgeable and quick to respond. He has great background knowledge of all of the equipment I buy. I plan on purchasing gift certificates for my dive buddies because - why go to another site?  Thanks for the great customer service - Tammy Hopkins</Review>< UserId.>

Tom was able to find another wetsuit  since the one we ordered was out of stock & it the new one would ship out today. He was very friendly and helpful over the phone.  He said he has the same wetsuit. We appreciate the great service. We usually get it the next day. My husband uses his wetsuit for work so we've gone through a lot of wetsuits. We've had really good luck w/ your website & we refer you all of the time. Thanks again</Review>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>I went in as a person brand new to scuba diving with no knowledge of gear whatsoever. I needed to buy a mask, fins, snorkel, gloves, and boots for my scuba class, so I went in just to get some advice on what to buy and how to buy. Miguel was super nice about showing me different types of masks and fins at different price points and his recommendations. He spent a good 45 minutes with me and my girlfriend just talking about gear. Another local dive shop basically gave us the cold shoulder when we went in to seek advice only. We were so satisfied with Miguel's customer service and the shop's selection of gear that we decided to come back a few days after and purchase from them even though we aren't taking our classes with them. Great products at solid price points with excellent customer service. Would recommend this place to anybody looking to buy scuba gear!<//text></record>

<Text>I went into the store and Dave was very helpful.   I lost my Atomic mask today and he found an exact replacement for $40!  It was used but looked brand new.   Nice store front that let's you browser inventory on computer.  Place in your cart and press the service button.  2 minutes later a guy comes with your items to try out.  Great service.</Text>< Pics>

Love that I can shop online and pick up in store. They also help take the headache out of searching through racks of items by setting up laptops in the showroom. You can browse their selection from the laptop, place items you're interested in in the cart, press a button and presto! Someone comes out with the items you selected. They have multiple nicely sized changing rooms as well. Most importantly, they have friendly and helpful staff.< /Text>

I went to this store looking for a gift and loved the variety they have. Kristina was amazing. She was very detailed and knowledgeable about all the dive products. She truly knows the products and makes suggestions based on your personal needs and preferences.</Text>

I had ordered a product that was on backorder from the manufacturer. I received an email telling me a substitution was being made. I did not want the substitution so I used the live chat to get assistance. Dave was very helpful and even sent a new confirming email. The whole process took all of 5 minutes. Outstanding!</Review>

Arthur was amazingly helpful in guiding me through what wetsuit would work best with a tall thin lanky man. I'm 6 ft 140 lb, and I will now own the perfect wetsuit for my fit without having to try on 30 different suits in 6 different dive shops.
Thank you Dive Instructor Arthur!< /review>

I have made several purchases in the last couple months and it all started because they did a return of a unused new mask that I purchased over 6 months ago. That is great customer service. I will continue to buy all my Dive equipment from Dave who I have had the pleasure to deal with on several of my purchase questions. Anyone that answers the phones is very knowledgeable and eager to help. it doesn't get much better than this place. Keep it up.< /Text>

I had questions about BCD's and Wetsuits. I am a bigger guy and have limited options. I'm also on a budget so price was important. Dave was patient and very helpful in choosing what would work out best based on the info I gave. Very patient and knowledgeable.</Text>

Kristina AND Miguel are the BESt. Seriously I want to just hang out with them and buy stuff and get the best tips.  It is like being part of a very elite club coming in to see you guys. It makes me so excited to get in the water and dive and use my new gadgets. I LOVE this place. I flew out here from Missouri to bring my gear in and shop!  I know there are dive shops even where I live, but... nothing like your staff!  Keep doing just what you are doing.</Text>

Arthur was extremely helpful with information about a wrist dive computer. I’d say I’m 90% likely to buy the model he recommended. He answered many questions and was very friendly.<//Review>

<text>The store has awesome displays of marine life as decorations. Shopping is convenient using laptops in store, and supplies are available as the store also serves as a warehouse for supplies. Been buying stuff here for a couple of years now. Recently stopped by to check for batteries for my Oceanic Geo 2 watch and Kristina was there to help me out. The rest of the crew were alert and helpful as well. Will be back again for my scuba gear needs!<//text><user_id>114039765825219076389</user_id></record>

Great service and wonderful products.We purchased 2 Ocean Quest 17oz polyolefin dive suits at their recommendation. They fit great and were perfect for the 72 degree water temperature. Would recommend this service to everyone needing scuba gear.</text>

In the virtual sterile world of outsourced customer service orders, its so refreshing to do business with a US company.
Their prompt service and order support was superb.
>Fun transaction, would recommend to all.<

I always coach people who are not competitive athletes, to swim laps with a small goggle-mask, and most importantly, to attach a snorkel,
as it allows ease of breathing, thereby making distance swimming a breeze...

Buy your gear from these folks, and have fun!< /Text>

I bought a shark skin and I love it. I have to use almost no weight and it's better than my 3mm aqua lung wetsuit. Very comfortable and also a great design. I recommend to try it.</text>

Ordered a pre-owned XS Scuba Deluxe Yoke/Din Pressure Checker. Received the unit super fast--2 days, even over a holiday weekend! Unit in prime condition! A few smudges but nothing can't be wiped off! No scratches, and the unit worked perfectly--like New! Very pleased! Will definitely shop & purchase from again! Thanks!</Review>

Had a situation that the older model wetsuit I ordered was actually out of stock...  Called customer service and spoke to Arthur - who not only told me I would be getting the newer suit model for the same price but worked out a shipping solution for me that get the suit to me before I leave!  Awesome customer service!<//review>

Kristina is the best instructor ever!!! I met her in my first open water class and now just finished my rescue course with her and have to say I have never had a better instructor. She is kind, patient, fun, professional and has such an infectious fun loving spirit that makes you so stoked to dive. She inspires me to continue diving and to become a professional diver. She goes above and beyond to make your experience the best and really appreciate her for that! Overall if you the chance to dive or learn from her, you are a lucky individual :) xoxo< /text>

I couldn't make a decision on whether the sealife 4500 video light and the wide angle lens would be good fit for my current set up (DC2000 with 2500 video light, sealife strobe).  I chatted with Dave on line and he made me feel more comfortable with my decision since he also used the system I have.  To make a long story short, he was a lot of help and he was very patient with all my questions that I decided to proceed with the sale.  He even gave me a 10% discount.  This experience has made me feel that is going to be my next go-to place for my scuba gear needs.  Thanks a lot Dave<//review>

Had a situation that the older model wetsuit I ordered was actually out of stock...  Called customer service and spoke to Arthur - who not only told me I would be getting the newer suit model for the same price but worked out a shipping solution for me that get the suit to me before I leave!  Awesome customer service!<//text>

<review>Instructor Dave was very knowledgeable and helped me get into the right BC for the type of diving I do-  I travel extensively, and always looking to have my kit just in case.  He explained the pro/con to the models I was looking at, his perspective, and I was able to get it at a great price!</review>< pictures>

<review>My divewatches battery tanked on me on a Sunday morning. Talked with Derrick on the chat to see if they could replace the battery for me before my trip. He said they were unable to do so, BUT he offered a solution which was a watch store store in the Mission Viejo mall that might be able to do it. Really appreciated Derricks going the extra mile to offer a possible solution. Thanks again.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I placed an order that required next day shipping, I placed the order but placed the wrong address, as I used paypal they could not redirect order, and since I was about 30min from hitting shipping deadline Darrick was great in assisting with the canceling of my order so I could reorder. the reason being I had selected the final product in stock for my order. Thank you Darrick for taking care of me.</text>

I like the quick shipping service and the inventory.
The only place I can buy replacement parts for my Sherwood Wisdom computer.
A bit pricey for seals and batteries, but given the unique nature of the inventory, I give them a 5!< /review>

<Text>Great prices and selection, no doubt due in part to their online presence, but also terrific in-store customer service.  The sales rep Chance pulled out half the stores inventory so I could try everything on, and didn't try to upsell me on a single item.

Just called for timeline on regulator service for my atomic; they quoted 8 weeks turn around with dropping it off at the store. WOW! At that rate I can get formally trained on how to do it myself and walk to the closest atomic supplier to pick up the parts.

Follow up 10/11/16: A representative reached out to me; and explained the delay on the timeline with the rush at the end of the season and offered an expedited service option in the event I still needed the regulatory service. Appreciate the responsiveness to customer feedback.<//review>

This time of year, as the summer diving season ends, we do see an increase in the number of regulators brought and mailed in for service.   The closing of the Sport Chalet chain has also brought an increase in equipment brought or sent to us from all over the greater Southwest region.  Our technicians are working as quickly as they can, while still maintaining our high levels of quality in their work.\n\nIf you are in a hurry or have a deadline we do offer an option for expedited service, for a small fee, that will bring your equipment to the head of the line.'}<//Resp>

Sometimes mistakes happen.  My first order with these folks was a disaster.  That said, even after returning everything & washing my mind of the damage.  The manager Reggie stepped up when he did not have to.  Refreshing to see a company willing to admit to a mistake and take actions so that it does not repeat.  The second order was correct and timely. Highly recommend these folks, they really do care about getting you geared up for the next adventure.</text>

THIS IS NOT A REAL SHOP. IT IS AN ONLINE STORE ONLY

Wow. This shop is a joke. Maybe they used to be worth something, but now they are useless.
Dropped a BC:reg:comp two months ago to be serviced. At first they said it would be two weeks and I was 3rd in line (two services ahead). Two weeks later I call and they say the part is in it's been cleaned and it might be a few more days. Today I call and NO WORK HAS BEEN DONE  I am apparently still second in line!!! The excuse "it's just the season" well it was another season when I dropped it off. You only serviced a single unit in that time period? Or did you bump other people in front of me?!

Apparently they don't have a dive instructor or anyone who fixes equipment. This should be known as an online store ONLY THEY DO NOT SERVICE EQUIPMENT.</text>

I recently ordered the Scubapro Seawing Nova from these guys.  I spoke to Dave via their chat function and he was fantastic!  Having the ability to pick the brain of a dive instructor is incredibly valuable when picking out gear.  It's not as if you get to try your gear out and THEN decide.  no test drives with scuba gear, so i find it to be incredibly valuable to pick the brain of an expert.  I should also mention that Dave wasn't showing me the most expensive gear,  he was just showing me the gear he felt would best enhance my dives.  Dave is the man!!<//text>

< review>
Ordered a couple scuba bags in hopes they were the same Atlantic bag we used for training, but when we got them it was the Atlantic Free Diver bag which is much longer and wouldn't hold all of our gear.  I followed the steps to get an RMA# and was going to exchange it for different bags but I ended up just ordering them without the exchange because we needed them by a certain date. I emailed CS and they switched my exchange to a refund without any hassle...it is very much appreciated!!  Can't wait to order more!</review>

Very helpful staff, the show room is bare, but as soon as you request an item, it is brought out to you. A different type of shopping experience, a cross between shopping through the site and being able to see the gear and ask advice from the staff.<//text>

I placed an order on Thursday July 16th for three items 2 pairs of gloves and 1 pair of wet suit pants. I needed these items by the following Friday for an upcoming trip. The web site states that all orders will be shipped the next day. This did not happen. On Monday July 20th I received an email that one pair of the gloves were not in stock. I told them to take it off the order and ship the remainder. Kevin told me that they would ship it 3 day since they had not shipped it on Friday so it would get here for my upcoming trip.Fantastic!  It did not arrive on Thursday so I called and spoke to Bob. He told me it had not been shipped but he would overnight it to me so I would have it by Friday. Terrific!  It did not arrive on Friday so I called and spoke to Aaron. He was very apologetic and said he would have it sent over night Saturday delivery where I was going in Florida. Unbelievable! When I arrived in Florida I received an email stating that the package had been delivered. My first thoughts were great! Shortly thereafter, I found out that it had been delivered to my address in Atlanta not the address I had given Aaron the previous day.  Obviously, I was unable to use the equipment I had ordered and I am sure they would take it back if I want to go through the effort of shipping it to them. However, the real point here is that they had four opportunities to get this right but somehow found a way to screw it up. Each time I asked what happened they blamed "the system".  It is their "system" and someone might want to take a look at it.< /Review>

We purchased 2 Scubamax Snorkel Vests and used them last week in Roatan, Honduras.  The vests were awesome!  Comfortable, lots of pockets, adjustable, and they dried super fast.  We would HIGHLY recommend these for any level!!< /Review>

<review>Phenomenal customer service! Made my order on the 8th of the month and I just got my open water class portion done and my first dives are the 18th and 19th. I got my confirmation email and it said the goggles I chose were back ordered till the 23rd, with this companies wide variety of gear to choose from I had a few other options I liked so I called to cancel my order or change to a different set and (I can’t remember this guys name off hand) the guy I talked to was extremely nice and helpful! He gave me an option that was very similar but I had a few other options in mind so I said I would call back to change the order. I called back and spoke with Dave, and Dave showed me another option that was very similar to the one I had originally picked out with a better lense and on sale! To say the least, customer service was top notch and very helpful! They definitely have my future business<//review>< Pictures>

<review>My order was back-ordered from the company so I started a chat to check on it. I had the pleasure of getting Dave who ROCKS!!!  Not only was he nice and found out what was going on with my order but since he could not get it to me by me next dive, he upgrades my BCD and overnighted it to me. Thank you again Dave. You have a customer for life now.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp>< username>

They messed our order up pretty darn bad (even lied to us ) and we did not have our things in time and the day we had to leave for our trip we had to drive to OC  hours away from our house to get some of our order. We really had Zero time for this. And the gas price to drive there was just stupid!
We have been customers for 13 years, and they are really getting bad. We decided Not to buy with them any more. Very dissapointed.< /review>

{'time': 1508887065130, 'text': 'Our tail is totally between our legs on this order.  We are very sorry we were unable to get it to you in time.  We discussed with you we would try but couldn’t guarantee the specialized mask with lenses would be in time for your vacation.  We offered a different  mask and lens solution but those were turned down.  Upon receiving the first mask and lenses from the vendor one of the optical lenses was chipped.  In order to accommodate your wishes we shipped the mask with lenses to your first vacation destination only for it to be held up in Puerto Rico longer than the first leg of the trip.  Unfortunately, Puerto Rico has been devastated by hurricanes causing major delays.  We were trying to have another mask reach you for the 2nd destination of your trip but after countless hours on the phone with both FedEx and UPS there was no way to have the packaged cleared for customs without going through Puerto Rico.   We are all divers here and we completely understand you wanted to don a mask that will help you see better underwater.  Due to unfortunate circumstance after unfortunate circumstance there was no way to get you the specialized mask with lenses in time.  Again we are very sorry we were unable to help you with this mask and we apologize for any inconvenience we have caused you.  Despite the mask issue we hope you still had a fantastic trip!'}</resp>

<Time>1480618822255< /Time><Rate>5</Rate><review>I was looking to buy a wetsuit as a Christmas present for my Niece. I dont have any of her measurements other than her weight and height. I also dont know anthing about diving gear or apparel. I was pleased to see on their website that they have an option to live chat. I was quicly connected with an experienced dive instructor named Darrick and told him what I was looking for as stated above. I also told him I was looking for a suit in the price range of $60-100. Given the limited info he suggested a wetsuit which turned out to be perfect. It was right at $100 and he told me to get a Medium. I had been on other sites browsing and came upon different size charts. With the input of my niece's w&h on three different sites I was given three different size abbreviations....8-9, 10, & x-small. I relayed that info back to Darrick with the question of why he suggested to get a Medium. He told me in detail what the size charts mean and what's most important. He then posted a link for the wetsuit he suggested which was extremely helpful as I had no idea what to look for.
I was very impressed with his knowledge and more impressed with how quick he responded to my questions over a live chat. All the live chats I've been on take so long to get a response or I was disconnected. I would definitely refer this site to anyone who wants to get scuba gear and real time advice and suggestions if needed. Helpful, courteous, and easy.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1482173377496, 'text': 'Hi Nicholas, Thank you for taking the time to write your review!

"we don't have your order",
"Your order is lost"
"The responsible department is not answering"
"Bs bs bs.." and they never admitted that they screwed up my order or said sorry.
I drove there to pick it up because they were soo uncompetent to do it them selves.</Review>< Response>
{'time': 1476817657756, 'text': 'We apologize for the inconvenience you experienced with your order.  It looks like you originally placed your order with an international credit card shipping to the USA.  To expedite the billing/shipping verification you checked out again using the Amazon checkout button.

In your case it took 24 hours for us to get a response back from Amazon releasing the funds for your order.  Based off your helpful feedback we will revisit our international credit card procedures to work on getting this more streamlined.

I highly recommend finding a local dive shop, don't buy from this company online - if you have an issue, they won't stand behind making it right.

My experience was horrible. Mares BC was rigged improperly with a splitter on air supply to inflater and gauges which introduces an additional failure point. Naturally, this failed and instead of waiting weeks for them to warrant, I got it fixed for $100 at local dive shop. 15 dives later, the inflater button failed and constantly fills BC with air.

I email customer support and expect them to make it right but no response for a week. I call and after 5 minutes on hold, am connected to someone who tells me Mares only has 1 year warranty. I point out their website says 2 years and he agrees. Based on all the issues and lack of response, I ask for a new inflater hose to be drop shipped so I can make a dive next week and am offered - you can send it to us, we'll mail it to Mares and get the warranty work done - should take about 4 weeks after Mares receives it.

The rep says "yeah, I understand, sorry but that all we can do". Headed to local dive shop to pay for 2nd repair on 1 year old BC.</review>

<review>Have a pair of Seawing fins and they are the old pair. I popped a strap and could not find a replacement. Thanks to Dive Instructor Darrick on the site I got a replacement upgrade assembly and I can't be happier! You guys are why I will always go ScubaPro!<//review>< user>

The kind of staff, especially of Arthur, did not make me realize that I was talking to the other head of the world. Few times I have found such competence and speed in an online chat.
Certainly a company from which to buy with confidence.
Thank you guys. And if you pass from Imperia, to Italy, send me an email: it will be a pleasure to take a dip, with your new equipment !!!

10.000 km di distanza e non rendersene conto.
La gentilezza dello staff, specialmente di Arthur, non mi ha fatto accorgere che stavo parlando con l'altro capo del mondo. Poche volte ho constatato una simile competenza e rapidita in una chat on line.
Certamente una azienda da cui acquistare con fiducia.
Grazie ragazzi. E se passate da Imperia, in Italia,  inviatemi una email: sarà un piacere fare un tuffo, con la vostra nuova attrezzatura!!!
