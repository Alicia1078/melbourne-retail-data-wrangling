Very good experience. The lady at the front counter was really friendly and polite. One of the drivers helped get my belongings from my vehicle that was in the accident. I highly recommend BG & sonüëçüëç<//text>

Ever since these guys made me a custom "No Parking" sign to post in my parking lot, my problem with people illegally parking disappeared. Of course if you are in the towing business, you are generally going to have low reviews, given all the pissed-off people who had their cars towed. However, from a property owner perspective, this is a five-star company all the way!</text>

Shady people! They towed our car from a gated air b&b in the middle of the night. Their story changed several times. Seems that this business is doing more harm than good. I plan to report them to the bbb. From their number of poor reviews it seems like they have been at this scam for far too long! It‚Äôs time to put a stop to this nonsense.< /review>

Followed us into the apartment complex we stopped in front of the dumpster to take our sleeping two year upstairs with our groceries and tow truck driver immediately towed our car, security saw it all. This complex does not have designated parking or unloading zones which is why we had to stop. I called B&G and guy argued with me on the phone like he was 3 years old. Tired of them preying on innocent hard working people. Isn't the first time the company has done something like this. I will be contacting the news<//review>

They were very helpful. A mix up on a wrong parking spot with some unkind people thought letting the air out of my tires was cool then calling to have it towed on top of that... Any who the guys just doing their jobs put air in my tires and the price was fair. Made a horrible experience less stressful.< /Text>

My car got stolen. Police called last night informing it's been towed by these guys yesterday. First thing this morning I went there. They claimed the car was towed couple days ago and wanted a payment of $350. The car is only work $1500 due to its condition. I don't have that kind of money. I have filed police report for stolen vehicle so it shouldn't even be that much. I'm just going to leave the car there because I can't afford it.<//Text>

Anderson Towing is great...called them twice in the last year.
My son's car was towed from school, but insurance was in my name and he didn't have his registration, so BG Towing didn't want to release the car. I had to ask for the (rude) boss, since the person I spoke to didn't know if he could just call the insurance company to verify/fax my son's ownership and insurance. When I spoke to the owner to ask he wouldn't let me get a question out and kept interrupting my inquiry and hung up on me when I was trying to ask for  the fax number to send the verification.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

They purposely violate the law.  They will leave the lot and not return until after 5pm to keep your vehicle longer, charge you additional fees, and make you pay a gate fee.  All of this is a violation of the law.  They are crooks.  They should not be allowed to do business.<//Review>

Do NOT BUY FROM HERE. Bought a car here for rather cheap. Guy was "Firm" on price but right before he sold it said it may be a lemon and not to come back to him about it. 4 months later the ball joint separated on the freeway and sent me flying off the side into a tree. I could've died from this death trap that they sold me.DO NOT BUT FROM HERE.<//review>

<Review>I love BG& Sons, they do their jobs right. and parking is not that complicated so if you get towed thats because 1. you parked where you weren't supposed to. or 2. your parked in someone else's spot. People shouldnt be mad when you dont follow rules. its simple.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80900d5c639ce089:0x32365c3cae292962< /GmapID></record>

Thieves.  They broke multiple laws when towing my car.  Their credit card machine was down so they held our car hostage and charged us for the time it took for us to find the money to pay.  They took our car at early am so we didn't have access to the things we needed to get our car back.  Shady bunch, we won't them let them extort us and if you get caught up with this company they will extort you.< /Text>

Great company! They do what needs to be done. If you can't follow the rules or signs than it's your issue not theirs. Very respectful driver and office lady. Highly recommend them. And the office dog is a sweetheart< /text>

Very friendly and efficient service. I came in around 9am and was out in 6 min after the young lady working that morning was very generous and welcoming! They need more customer service workers like this I will most definitely be back ü§ûüèº< /Review>

I called ahead of time to see if they had meatballs ,  Ariana answered the phone and said hello & I asked if they had meatballs & proceeded to say you‚Äôre funny , & said they were closed when they didn‚Äôt close until 9:30 & it was 8:35 , super rude & unprofessional. I called back to ask for her name & she said sorry & laughed. I hung up , I will be calling tomorrow to speak to a manager because I don‚Äôt appreciate it.</Text>

I felt like they were all about throwing my sandwich together and getting me out of the store as fast as possible and my sandwich looked like it. The sandwich was kinda unaplealing due to its looks. Good luck with your sandwich when you visit this location.<//Review>

<text>For a Subway this is a good shop to go to and eat. They are greeted you as you come in and are fast to get your order done as Subway sub shops go. They keep it clean and everything looks fresh not old.<//text>< Pictures>

Walked into this store around 2 PM, July 6. 2 workers behind the counter making 5 foot long sandwiches. I waited approximately 3 to 4 minutes before I was acknowledged, then one of the workers commented, we will be right with you. right after the worker acknowledged me a young man walked in and up to the cash register with his phone out and was asked can I help you as soon as reached the register. I walked out at that point.  Not once did they even look up in my directions. I sure hope this is one time event but I will not be back. I don't even want to give 1 star but have no choice</text>

<Text>I agree with most of the reviews i read. I stopped while on a business trip. The prices are definitely a reflection of the demographic. The charm and charisma of the owner made it worth the trip. I'd return if only for the delicious aroma and banter.<//Text>< pictures>

The guys that work here are great, they're knowledgeable, and they have the BEST selection of Kratom. I asked them if they carried Charlotte's web CBD oil and they said no. I few weeks later they had it in stock. Don't go anywhere else if you can help it :-)<//text>

< review>
Went in to buy some Kratom and the guy tried charging me supposedly $10 for 10 grams. Then we had it reweighed in a bigger bag and it weighed less. Then we had him weight without the bag and it wad double so something's wrong with however they're charging people I refused and asked for my money back I wouldn't go back to this place</review>

THE best smoke shop around! I was calling everywhere looking for these specific cigars ("Arturo Fuente Opus X") for my boyfriend and Los Feliz Smoke Shop actually had them! I told the guy I'd be down there in 20 minutes and to please hold them for me. The guy was super helpful and had everything ready to go for me when I got there. Boom, it was that easy and they've EARNED a loyal customer!< /Review>

i keep coming back to this place. They have the best selection and quality of kratom in Los Angeles. Their staff if very friendly too and can help you find the right strain you're looking for. Their kratom menu is also very helpful. I definitely would recommend this place to a friend. It can't be beat!<//text>

<review>Rip off. Super expensive for not great quality. It cost $30 for 30 grams. For that price online you can get 250 grams of way better quality. I guess if you are a first timer, the store does have many differnt strains to offer. My advice people is to google best kratom vendors and you will be plesantly surprised. And your wallet will thank you too! I also thought this place was just a straight up KRATOM shop and CBD. But its just any other smoke shop that sells kratom and not very well informed of the products they carry.

If you are not a smoke shop, then why does it say "SMOKE SHOP" on the front of the store? And anybody that knows anything about kratom knows that anything over $10/oz is a rip off! There's a reason when you google top kratom vendors your company does not come up. I challenge any of your customers to purchase from one of these top kratom vendors and get back to you about the quality and outrageous price of your product.</review>< Date>

Cute store with a lot of flowery printed options. Not quite what I was looking for. I wished there were more notebooks, but they do have a large variety of paper and stationery choices. The store is very organized and very clean.<//text>

So pricey but everything is so cute! Dont get washi tape from here though. It's an arm and a leg and they're not even cute! But the journals, planners, stick notes, desk organizers, etc everything else is so beautiful.< /Review>

Only stopped in here to pick up a birthday card and was impressed at the selection of creative/non-typical cards. I didn't really browse the rest of the store but it seemed to be well stocked with craft supplies and other small items. Staff were super friendly and helpful.< /Text>

I have gone to Paper Source several times in need of a gift or card for an improptu after-work happy hour for colleagues' birthdays or other special events. Paper Source always has interesting, fun, and often useful items; it's sort of like a quirkier, cheaper Anthropologie. For instance, I found a great adult dot-to-dot book of famous architecture that was the perfect gift and not very expensive.
I also found what is now my favorite insulated water bottle there, as Paper Source carries quite a few Corkcicles, which I'd never seen prior to being in the store, but which I now love with a deep and abiding passion. There's always someone around to help you and the employees have all seemed genuinely friendly and happy to help. Check them out!< /review>

< review>
I went to the store to buy a card and a paper bag. I was at the payment process and put my credit card password, then I saw on the computer screen "approved". The girl on the cashier said: "Your transaction is not finished, you need to pass your card again." I told her twice that I saw the transaction went ok and the card was approved. She said in a very rude way that she could not "let me go out the store with this" (the items) because the transaction was not finished. I called to my credit card in Brasil. The transaction was ok, they charged me and the transaction went all the way. I came back to the store, paid AGAIN and try to solve the situation calling them and talking with the manager. She said that the computer shows that I was charged only once, which I can prove is not true. I don't know about their system, I just know that I was charged twice and had to call my bank to cancel the transaction. Not even one "I'm sorry, Miss". Nothing. Very cool store, but we got cool stores all over SD. Paper source never again.< /review>

There's variety of items for gifts packing.
But it is a little bit expensive.< /Review>

<Text>Portions are big and price is very reasonable. The amount of mollejas (sweet bread) for only 10 dollars was great.
Food is delicious and service is awesome too.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c2bca09f5e603b:0x92dada3837e642a0< /GmapID><Date>1491839760121</Date>< response>

<text>The place is nice but small, even this. No need of reservation. For red meat you have to wait a lot but it is worth. Wine selection is fine. For a foreigner might be little bit over priced but for a local might be ok.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
Left our visit to this grill to the last night of our holiday hopping it would be special and memorable . Special it was not ,memorable yes but in the wrong sense of the word. First it was that dark in the restaurant we had to use the phone lights to read the menus . Two of us ordered Ribeye steak to be told that they had none (a steak house) ! We placed our Fillet Minion order noting that the waiter did not write anything down. On his return he was in doubt of which steak was which ( well done or med. rare ). After visiting the chef he placed our plates down and left. I had a different selection of vegetables on my plate from my original order ( looking around we all had the same selection ) but as I  was being treated I remained quiet. The peppercorn sauce was more mushroom than sauce. After eating one of the two small steaks I could not face the second due to being over cooked. My cousin also left his second piece as for him it was to rare. Obviously  the plates were given incorrectly but as no one came over at any time  to ask if everything was OK we had to bring it to their attention. On reflection I think they need to feed the electric meter and buy the waiter a pen.< /Review>

This place is bustling with good reason.  The complimentary garlic dip/oil with bread is addictive.  Portions are fair.

I had the grilled salmon with garlic vinaigrette with mashed potatoes & broccoli. It usually comes with rice & sauteed spinach but the waitress volunteered that I could switch out the sides for other ones.  Yipee!  The salmon was drizzled lightly with a citrus/mustard sauce.  The salmon itself was neither undercooked nor over.  It was a good meal for a reasonable price.</Review>

Delicious, wonderful experience.  Must love Argentianian steak, wine, and panqueques!  Gorgeous decor and great service!  Everything is fresh-nothing frozen.  Owner came by our table to check on us a few times.  Great date spot.  3 dollar garage parking right next to restaurant.<//text>

Great place for dinner or lunch. The service is attentive, not pretentious, and the place is chill. If you're a fan of steak, they make some darn good cow. For those in West LA (Brentwood / Westwood) they deliver too.</text>

<Text>I splurged on the steak with the chimichurri sauce on the side and it was amazing. Service was quick and the staff was lovely.

The place was rather empty when we went for an early dinner around 5/5:30ish.

<rating>3<//rating><Time>1499638458938</Time><review>Waiter argued about tip and drinking while on the clock: First time dining here, I was expecting good quality customer service. The waiter came took our order and forgot about the 2 kids meal we ordered and just brought the mix parillada (adult dish) due to the delay we did not want to wait more longer on my kids meal therefore we shared from our parillada. We ended up having the busser pretending to be our waiter. The bus boy did an amazing job offering and bringing refills. While the waiter, hostess and 2 more employees sat on a table with plates and wine glasses we said ok maybe there on break. That break took more than 45 minutes. Whispered to my husband employees drinking wine and having this guy do their waiter job, just thought wasn't right. Not happy with their way of work skills and ethic left 5.00  dollars tip. The waiter approached me and asked why just a 5 dollar tip we explained our reasons and the waiter said we'll we all work minimum wage here I think we deserve more. I commented your unhappy with my tip I was unhappy with service you don't want them I'll take them back and yes, he gave them back saying how unhappy he was with this job, I advised looking for a better job plus tip is based on service and no one is obligated to leave a tip. They are already working making salary wage it's a job and you're getting paid for. Just like every other hard worker.</review>< user_name>

Location, location, location!

Gaucho Grill in Brentwood is located on beautiful San Vicente Blvd. This location is truly aesthetically pleasing! The outside is lovely, with its little quaint tables and sparkling lights. Once inside you find a myriad of natural rich woods, stone, iron work and at the center of the main dining area a beautiful series of high arches that are lined with natural stone. The deep red walls inside the cove of arches creates a truly warm setting. I could not decide if I was more reminded of the richness and warmth of restaurants in Spain or the restaurants of Northern Italy. All I can say is that all of us that dined that evening felt very pleased by our surroundings.

We were greeted at the door by the host immediately. The server that helped us was Marilo and she was very helpful and very detailed.

I had gone to a special dinner event at the Gaucho in Long Beach before this night and the Chef there had told us that this Gaucho Grill along with the Gaucho Grill in Long Beach have taken steps to go their own path in regards to ingredients used. This kitchen never sees a frozen meat, poultry or fish and all of the herbs, garlic, onions and vegetables are purchased fresh, not frozen. They use natural or organic produce only. High quality oils such as olive oils are infused in their kitchen and they cook to order.

The Meal

Started with the traditional bread and famous Chimichurri sauce, I am not a big eater of bread, but it was warm, fresh and light. It was perfect for the delicious Chimichurri sauce. I know I have not tried all Chimichurri sauces out there, but they do have my favorite Chimichurri sauce to date.

Appetizer
We shared a sampler appetizer with empanadas, chorizo, and sauteed mushrooms. Our friend (the meat eater) loved the chorizo as it was perfectly seasoned. I had the spinach empanada and it was probably the best spinach and cheese empanada I've had. The spinach was fresh, the cheese light and nutty flavored and perfectly melted inside the shell. Delicious! This empanada knocked my previous #1 off the list! The mushrooms were covered in a rich savory sauce of garlic and wine. They were excellent!

Main Course
Garlic chicken breast with rice and spinach. You can choose the sides you want for your entree and their are quite a few great choices, including grilled vegetables which my friend ordered and I ate half of because they were exquisite! It was grilled eggplant, yellow and green zucchini and they were perfect!  I can certainly taste when chicken is fresh and this was. Not a hint of frozen texture or flavor. It was grilled and served with a sauce of garlic and tomatoes. I would like a little less sauce, but the flavors were truly wonderful. The spinach was light  with great consistency and the yellow rice was good and had a nice seasoning.

Dessert
We ordered two; their chocolate souffle, it was very good and light.  But I focused most on the signature Argentine favorite panqueques with dulce de leche! Argentina is famous for its meats, its Chimichurri sauce, its wines, Tango, Futbol, gorgeous people and DULCE DE LECHE! And the dessert at Gaucho, did not disappoint! Perfectly Argentine, perfectly home made and delicious!

I have to admit, I did try a bit off of my forgiving friends plates and I will note that the portobello mushrooms over my friends steak and grilled onions were really yummy! And as mentioned before I did enjoy the grilled vegetables very much!

Gaucho grill is known for its steaks, but it also has some pretty great home made pastas, which is very Argentine due to the Italian influence in the country. And it has a very well thought out wine list. Gaucho carries specialty boutique wines only from great small vineyards in Argentina and here in California!

I really enjoyed that room with those arches!<//Text>

Used to be my favorite place to go.  What happened?  Food brought to table ranged from cold to lukewarm....Sent back..arrived overcooked and warm..terrible waste of money and time.  So sad. Perhaps the chefs night out?????<//text>

(Translated by Google) I went with the family and I have to say that we were thrilled with the mixed meat dish we ordered on the advice of the waitress who was courteous for the whole evening, the kitchen is in sight and maybe I repeat myself but the meat is really delicious .

Ci sono andato con la famiglia e devo dire che siamo rimasti entusiasti del piatto misto di carne che abbiamo ordinato su consiglio della cameriera che √® stata cortese per l'intera serata, la cucina √® in vista e forse mi ripeto ma la carne √® veramente deliziosa.</Text>

First, let me say that I have never left a review before, but felt absolutely compelled after seeing some people that had a negative experience. I hope that someone sees this when they are trying to find a place when they are in as tough of a spot as I was.

Dr. Madearis is an absolute gem. She is kind, thorough and really explained things in a manner that was easy for me to understand. It's nice to feel like you are included in the process of treating your pet. The communication from the clinic as a whole was very good, even in the pandemic, when they have a bunch of excuses for not being communicative.

It wasn't cheap. But it was worth it to get my cat back and good health. They did that and made me feel like Topper was in great hands the whole time. So much so, that she will be going there in the future regardless of the price. Thanks, from both of us!< /Review>

When my adorable Pembroke Welsh Corgi needed emergency help yesterday and that same corgi's mom was up in LA, my caring neighbor took her immediately to VCA in Indio.  Emmy was taken right in to see Dr.  Boone, and, the Dr. successfully took care of Emmy's problem.  My neighbor raved and raved about the kindness of the staff and the efficiency of the office.  Needless to say, my drive back from the City of Angeles was a worrisome one, but, when my dog greeted me at the front door looking A+, my worries were elated.  Hats off to this VCA for caring so much for the "love(s) of my life"!!!!!!!</text>

I will say the care they provided was very good. Their professionalism and quality is great. I took my cat here as a last resort emergency visit as they were the only available vet on a Saturday. However, the initial treatment they recommended was 7400 dollars which I could not afford and the treatment they ended up giving my cat was still 1000 and temporary. I ended up having to take my cat to another vet a week later for the same issue. The second vet offered the same initial treatment as VCA Indio but for 1000 instead of the 7400 dollar cost. If you have the money to spend then I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll give you fine treatment. If you‚Äôre like me and have a tight budget (and have the option of going elsewhere) I highly suggest going somewhere else.< /Review>

<text>First of all, they misspelled my pet's name even though we spelled it out and it is written on her neck. Second, their price for keeping her for 2 days was $4,500. Google said the highest price for 5 days was $3000 and it was way above that for just 2. When asked if there was any wiggle room in the price, their exact words were "No, your other option is to take your pet home and let her deteriorate." For just $700 they sent us home with all of the medications that she would receive at the hospital so why would the price be so different and why would her being home make her deteriorate if it's the same treatment. A lot of the other reviews said that this place is just money hungry. When we asked questions about dosage, instead of just answering the question. We were laughed at, and told "the paper says" when it didn't say. This was a very bad experience, I suggest going to ANY place other than here. I also watched them be just as mean to all of the other people waiting in the parking lot. People go through a lot of stress when their pet isn't feeling good, they could at least have some compassion.<//text>< Name>

I recently had to have my fur baby euthanized. Needless to say, I was a wreck. From the moment I walked in I was treated with kindness and compassion. My regular vet couldn‚Äôt get me in for 6 days and I couldn‚Äôt stand to see my baby suffer for that long. I came in without an appointment and was taken care of immediately.<//Review>

<Text>First, I want to say not everyone at VCA was awful. There was one girl I spoke who who genuinely was very kind. That being said, I have had two really horrible experiences here. VCA vets seem to do the bare minimum, won't do everything within their power to help (even if there are options), and the prices are astronomical. Because this places has the vet techs do all the communicating important information got lost, misconstrued, or were misunderstood *BOTH* times. For example, I was told I was given an inhaler for my pet, but was actually given tablets. That's fine, in fact, I preferred that... but it wasn't communicated to me so I was very confused when I went to the pharmacy and thought I had the wrong stuff.

When I asked if my pet was calm and stable,  somebody at VCA told me, "Well, the vet recommended more diagnostic tests for a reason." ....I'm not sure this person even realized how wildly unhelpful that is as a reply. I understood the vet recommended nearly $2000 of tests, but that did not answer my question.

For a bit, I thought maybe this was what great vet care looks like. I blamed myself for just being anxious. Then, I was able to get her to Animal Samaritans this morning for the same urgent diagnostic tests recommended by VCA. The vet at Animal Samaritans took all the time I needed to answer my questions. In fact, that vet started right off the bat by letting me know my pet was a little upset about being there so they took some steps to help calm her. The vet also told me they would do a few things for her "just in case" because they know how expensive tests can be and wouldn't push any of them if we could help avoiding them.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

These kind people took excellent care of Neptune, our cat. This is an animal ER and they see your animal based on acuity- which is absolutely appropriate. I cannot state enough how happy we are that they were able to help our cat feel better and get him back on the right track. We followed up with our regular vet and they were helpful in sending his records from the er visit.
Thank you so much. You guys are awesome!<//review>

So here‚Äôs a story, my husky got out this morning but came back to our front door and was having breathing problems and was lethargic and wasn‚Äôt eating or drinking for my wife, she called this location and was told to just bring the dog because it‚Äôs an emergency and they‚Äôll figure out if she digested something that she shouldn‚Äôt have when she was out of the house, when I get off of work and go to bring her to this location we call and tell them we had talked to someone before and were told to just call before we got there (the whole ride there our dog didn‚Äôt move at all didn‚Äôt look out the window she just laid on the floor clearly not being herself and still not really eating), so anyways during the call they told us we might just be turned away if she‚Äôs not bad enough, we had assumed she ate something or got into something that was toxic or harmful to dogs and wanted to make sure our little husky was ok (we found our husky on the street after trying to return her to her owner and they just let her get out again and didn‚Äôt contact us when we said we had there dog, she‚Äôs very skinny cause for concern, and always scarfs down all the food we give her) we get there and wait a hour after they agree to see the dog just for someone to come look at her and have one of us walk her to their door at which time we‚Äôre told it will be at least 3 hours, me and my wife go get food and relax and when we‚Äôre don‚Äôt eating my wife calls, they said her exam was already don‚Äôt and the doctor was taking his time to call (poor work ethics), they then tell us nothing is wrong with our dog she‚Äôs fine and has no problems other than being skinny and we already knew that was a problem and wasn‚Äôt the reason we brought her in she is still the same and before we took her in so it wasn‚Äôt helpful at all, the doctor telling me she‚Äôs fine just skinny cost $80 for some reason and then they told me they could do other work for hundreds to thousands of dollars being stated multiple times (and kept telling me 80$ so far so clearly only caring about money) then we go and pay for her which was had enough when someone can‚Äôt copy numbers down (cough cough, front desk) and after that they said our husky would be out shortly, which took 45 minutes just to have someone give me a receipt and my dog back, making sure I saw the receipt and making sure I know much I paid. My dog looks more frightened walking next to that person than she did when we found her on the streets. I‚Äôm very disappointed and overpaid just to have someone tell me my dog has nothing to worry about but at the same time she doesn‚Äôt want to move eat or drink and still looks terrified.</Review>

So I've been here twice recently. Once in November of 2020 and now February 2021. Both times for an ear infection that cost me at least a good $430 each visit.

I hate to agree with all other horrible reviews, because they have helped me with Gigi. Its has came at a very costly price. It's TRUE, that they will only help if your willing to pay for what ever estimate they give you.  It is sad that they charge so much $ for exams that may not be helpful or required. They didn't not explain the medications to me until I asked the guy that handed her to me. I think he didn't speak English well because I could not understand him but I didn't want to be rude. I just figured I can look up on how to give her, her medications. ALTHOUGH I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT, SINCE THE VET SAID SOMEONE WOULD EXPLAIN THAT TO ME......

We come here because in an emergency it's the closest animal hospital that we know of. We've had a horrible experience with them back in 2013.

11-24-13 - Chico passed away
At my house, it felt like so many agonizing hours had gone by but it had been less then 24hrs since I had brought him home to die because i couldn't pay the 2 quotes that were given to me. 1 around $3,600 and 2nd quote over $6,000. Never did they offer me euthanasia and it didn't cross my mind. In my head I was trying to come up with at least the first quote. Watching a loved pet die when we have the option of euthanizing them, is outrageous.
I spent my holiday's crying in disbelief. Wondering why didn't I asked them to euthanize him. I was depressed for about a year and it took a lot for me to get over the way thing's went down. I still have both quotes saved in a box with my Chico's belongings...

I will be reporting her to where she obtained  her license. Horrible horrible , should be very ashamed.

My 6 month old, 4 pound Pomeranian was deathly ill. She was bleeding from her rectum and vomiting blood. We took her to this Emergency hospital about 6PM. After waiting for quite awhile, a technician finally came out and asked us a bunch of questions. He was wearing a mask and never came near my puppy that I was holding in my arms wrapped in a blanket. I was also wearing a mask. The technician turned us away saying they were too busy to take my puppy. Horrible, horrible experience. I had to wait until the next morning to take my puppy to my regular vet. I have added a photo of the blood from my puppy which I had shown to the technician.<//text>

< review>
It has been 2 and 1/2  months since my pet's visit at this hospital. I have gone back and forth about writing this review but I believe I need to share. On Valentine's day this year, my daughter dropped a pork rib bone and my pug ate it. It was around 5 pm that this happened, so I rushed him  to this hospital that is an hour away from me because when I called them and they asked what my emergency was they said he needed to come in right away. I got there and the check in process was fine, they came out and got him, gave him Subcutaneous fluid and anti-nausea medication so he would not throw up the bone. They also took x-rays. Then the doctor called me and said he could do surgery to remove it by either doing it endoscopically or cutting him open. They quoted me $9,000-$11,000 to do this. When I asked the doctor if my dog's stomach acid would break this down and he would be fine, he said to me "No, that won't happen" which sounded to me like surgery was the only option. I had already paid $1,100 for the x-rays, emergency visit, the fluid, and the medication.  I was devastated and unsure what to do, so I went with my gut and took him to my regular vet the very next day. My regular vet looked at the x-rays, and said that YES HIS BODY WOULD BREAK THE BONE DOWN. She did admit that she had never seen a dog swallow a pork bone so she didn't know how long it would take for him to break the bone down. She said to keep an eye on him for symptoms of pain, not wanting to eat, lethargy, etc. and that if any of that started to occur to bring him in. It has been 2 and 1/2 months now and I am happy to report my dog has broken down almost all of the bone, save for one little piece that is now left. My dog has been going back in once a month for x-rays to keep an eye on him. I normally am not one to say anything but I think it's wrong to quote people thousands of dollars for something that he may not have even needed. If you are a vet and don't know the answer to something, you should be honest with people, like my vet was when she admitted she had never dealt with that before. Had I not gone with my gut, I would have forked over all of that money and for what? Doctor Dalo is the one that helped my pet this night.<//review>

Molly was 22 yrs old.  After a really rough night I called VCA balling my eyes out at 7:30 am and they took Molly in right away. I told them we needed to put her out of suffering immediately and they let us go ahead. I realize people may have been mad, but Molly was suffering hideously and VCA and their staff were so thoughtful. It was a terrible time and nothing was going to give me comfort but I was surprised that after I said goodbye they wrapped her nicely in her favorite zebra print well and placed her in a nice little card board casket with fresh flowers taped on the top.  It was nice.  And the staff was very considerate.< /Review></record>

I was told my dogs condition - limping and to the point where he could no longer get up and walk, shortness of breath and shaking was not consider a critical condition.
I don‚Äôt understand why over the phone they mentioned to bring my dog over and for them to deny service to him in person. Definitely the worst animal hospital in the valley.< /Text>

<Review>I had a dog with severe diarrhea. I called at 7am to see if I should come in. I was told to come to the clinic and call from the parking lot. I called in from the parking lot to be told there was only one Doctor there. I would need to wait and they would get back to me. After waiting in the parking lot for 30 minutes, I received another call to be informed they can not see me and to call and find another Vet. Terrible service, especially when dealing with an ill dog and a concerned owner. Would NEVER recommend them.< /Review><Name>Pat Brzusek< /Name><gmapID>0x80daf85228e4e75f:0xf3c0302ed6b3c63c</gmapID>< pictures>

I can't thank the team at VCA enough for taking care of our girl. Our 5 month old pup Neesha became extremely ill while we were on a weekend away in Palm Springs and VCA were the only ones who were able to take her in. We came to find out she had parvo, even though she was fully vaccinated. Yes, it was a costly experience that had to be paid upfront, but the vet staff called us twice daily with updates and talked through Neesha's needs and improvements. She stayed 4 nights at VCA and it back to her usual self now. We are so thankful for the staff VCA for their incredible work nursing our girl back to health.< /Review>

They are over priced and do not care about you or your pets. I recently had to take my dog Buffalo here he was in pretty bad shape, I wasn't sure what was wrong. Something he ate I thought. They asked for 500$ to attempt to stabilize him. I said fine. Then they said they needed 2700$ to keep him overnight and see what happens. I said I don't have 2700$. They said we should put him down cause he's really suffering. I said no, they charged me 250$  total. 125$ for an emergency office visit, and 125$ for an IV and meds.i took him to his regular vet and they charged me 60$ for the ER visit, and 40$ to redo the IV VCA put in. They charged me 400$ x-rayed him, checked his blood, and liver. Kept him overnight and now he is doing fine. This place is a rip off, they should be shut down taking advantage of people with their pets. I want my 250$ back. Do not take your pets to this place. Banning veterinary hospital is the best and doesn't rip people off. I want my 250$ back VCA.<//Review>< Name>

Had the worst experience in this place!!! They care more about the money than actually helping the animals when they are in pain. Brought my dog since he was in pain, 2 hours after I had to call to ask for status and instead of giving me status of how my dog  health they give me all the expenses I have to pay before they can a diagnostic. Then I found out that no pain medication was given to him all this time...2 hours after... so he was there just like me waiting while he was in pain, they charged my credit card and still no pain medication!!!! Worst place to take care of our animals!!!<//text>

I was forced to come here for my dog's ear infection because his vet was booked for the month due to covid.  I arrived at 4:15 pm on a Monday after work and called the number that was posted (covid restrictions) from my car.  After 9 missed calls, they finally picked up. The assistant that came to get my dog said it would take "about 2 hours," but someone would reach out to me for a treatment plan shortly, so I should "stick around."

- 6:00 pm: I am called to discuss the treatment plan. I go home.
- 6:30 pm: The vet calls me to discuss her preliminary report. I'm put back on hold to the assistant who tells me dog will be ready in about 30 minutes.
- 7:00 pm: I arrive back at the hospital and my dog still isn't ready.  I call, get put on hold, then told another 15 minutes.
- 7:30 pm: I call again, put on hold. I'm now told he's coming out and to wait in my car.
- 7:45 pm: Still no dog, call again, put on hold, they tell me he's coming out.
- 8:00 pm: The vet calls me to give me the final report of my dog's visit. (I thought my dog was coming out 30 minutes ago ????)
At this point, I tell the vet to bring my dog out immediately.
- 8:15 pm : still no dog. My wife stops a worker that comes out to request our dog. He tells her he will bring him out.
-8:30 pm: We finally get our dog, an hour and a half later than expected. No courtesy call, a bunch of false information.

All in all, waiting almost 4 hours in the summer heat in my car after a long day at work, I've had enough.

Also, the final report that was given to was very suggestive of a "copy and paste" report.  someone else's dog's name was accidentally left in the report (my male dog isn't named Lola).

In conclusion: A 4 hour wait in the heat due to lack of proper communication from the staff; all empty promises.  $300 (which was overcharged $70 and in the process of being refunded) for an Ear Cytology (or fancy term for a Gram stain) and a topical cream...and a patient misidentification in the official take-home report.

Pro tip: if you are in need of last minute dog sitting, bring your dog here for a non-emergent visit.  They'll keep your little buddy.

Staff was friendly enough, at least as they were lying to me.

Never again.<//text>

I also had seen an emergency (maybe life threatening üò™) come in while I was waiting and they did not waste their time. They ran out to her car to get her pet and then came back out to update her and let her in to the office. Like I said I am not sure of the circumstances but they were very fast and I appreciate that they put in that extra effort. I highly recommend this office. Ps. They charge extra after certain hours.

This is the most incompetent organization I have ever dealt with. Save yourself the headache of taking any of your pets here. From being nearly impossible to connect with, charging different prices for the same services, then after paying in full, sending a false amount to collections. Being placed on hold then hung up "accidentally" on numerous occasions when calling them. Error with my puppy's surgery which turned 1 surgery into THREE. Having urgency to get payment for an invoice and requiring me to PULL over on the side of the freeway to give my card info on the way home versus just asking for that information while I was there!  However when picking up my puppy at the time they selected, made me wait 2 hours in the parking lot before giving her to me. Unprofessionalism galore. No one there speaks to one another, all seem to need training. Entire experience was beyond horrible and after they figure out how to tell collections I don't actually owe them anything, I hope to be done with them and will NEVER return!!!!!<//review>

<text>We had to euthanize our senior dog after a lengthy battle with cancer. Originally, I had looked into hiring a mobile vet, but they weren't willing to travel to our area during the pandemic. Our guy had a rapid decline one morning, and our regular vet was not available for Euthanasia in their office for 3 days. I didn't want our guy to suffer that long, so I contacted VCA. They were incredibly kind, and were able to take him in right away. They gave us time to say goodbye privately, and they helped Dex to pass peacefully. We paid for private cremation, and his ashes were returned to us in a beautiful wooden box along with a keepsake ornament of his pawprint. I cannot express how much our family appreciated the professionalism and empathy expressed by all of the VCA staff who took care of us in our time of need.< /text>< Pics>

I thought it was great that I could get her in right away. Well, I sat in the parking lot waiting for a tech to come get her and speak with me about her symptoms. It took 2 hours before anyone came out. (waiting in car due to covid restrictions). I waited another 2 hours in my car for the vet to call me. When he did finally call, he said he had no idea what could be wrong with her and he would need to do x-rays, blood work etc. So I waited for all of that to be done. 2 more hours later the vet calls me. "Oh good news, she has no cancer". Ok, wonderful news I thought. Didn't know he was looking for cancer! Then proceeded to tell me he would have to send out her blood work and he would call in a few days. Does not make sense. Well, I took my Savannah to another VCA vet in La Quinta the following week. In 10 minutes the doctor told me she probably has cancer. They tested her and she did have cancer. Before that week was up I had to send my precious girl to doggy heaven, she had gotten so bad.   2 weeks after her visit to Indio VCA, the doctor calls with results of her blood work and what we can do for her next. He works at an emergency vet hospital and it took 2 weeks to get a call back. Unbelievable!!!! And yes, I made numerous calls. Also very hard to get a hold of anyone. I wasted 6 hours and over $1000.00 for absolutley nothing. Charges are crazy no matter what time you get your pet there.< /Review>< userid>

Don‚Äôt go - they only want your money. Brought my dog in for respiratory issues, but it turned out to be an irritated trachea for being excited for a long period of time, and he‚Äôll make honking sounds. The vet however proceeded to tell me that his breathing was still unstable so he needed to be put on oxygen and if that didn‚Äôt work then they‚Äôd have to intubate him, possibly sedate him, and if he‚Äôs unresponsive to that then they‚Äôd have to put him into a coma so his body could reset. And I‚Äôd have to do that otherwise he could ‚Äúpass at any moment‚Äù because it was ‚Äúpretty bad right now.‚Äù Would have been 8K for just 24 hours. But so you‚Äôll know, he was fine by the following evening... without having to do ANY of that. Completely unnecessary, completely unprofessional, completely irresponsible. Avoid avoid avoid!</Review>

<Date>1611458427976</Date><Rating>2< /Rating><Review>I understand that we all need to be extra patient during this pandemic, and I appreciate businesses that put safety first. That being said, this was a nightmare.

The process to check in is not followed at all. You are instructed to call, but if you can get through, you sit on hold. Phone was busy for several tries, and when I got through I sat on hold for an hour while I watched others come and go by rudely flagging down techs or going inside (against COVID guidelines). I understand that treatment will be prioritized by urgency, and my dog has an ear infection, not urgent. I was being patient, but finally had to flag down a tech to let someone know I was there, I realized that I would be there forever if I didn't.

They took my dog when I was there for two hours. I can see and hear people bringing in their pets, and watched over a dozen non-emergencies be treated and finished while I sat.

At 5.5 hours I lost my patience. I can't get through on the phone to get any updates, and the poor techs are running around the parking lot, overwhelmed, and I can't flag one down. Now dozens of people have come and gone while I waited. The louder and more rude you are, the more likely you will be noticed.

I finally went inside and said that I wanted my dog back. I had already paid for her treatment and said I wanted a refund and that I would bring her elsewhere. They promised me just 15 more minutes, I agreed. 30 minutes later I was about ready to call the police if they would not give me my dog. They told me the treatment was done. I don't know if they rushed the treatment in those last few minutes or if it had been done awhile.

My complaint is NOT about the wait time. My complaint is about the lack of any process to prioritize care or communicate with customers. The only way to get treatment for your pet is to rudely interrupt someone else's treatment by screaming to get a tech's attention, or to barge inside, against COVID precautions. The poor techs. It was complete chaos.

As if this was not traumatizing enough for my dog, it seems they did not even give her water while they had her who knows where for hours. She drank two bowls of water at my car, and another big bowl of water as soon as we got home.<//Review>< pictures>

<Time>1610651426503</Time><Rate>1</Rate><Review>This place is very unprofessional. We took our pitbull here because he was ill on a Sunday morning at 8:30am. They charged us $250 to check him in the facility. They made us wait 6 hours with no update how our dog was doing or inform us about his condition. We had to call them back to check in. Finally someone came out after 6 hours of waiting to advised us to do a physical exam. Which we thought they already did. Then it costed us more money roughly about $500 do the physical exam. After we paid. They call us back 2 hours later saying he is not getting any better and its best to do surgery. We discussed about the outcome and our family decided to just take him home so he can pass away in the comfort in our house. The vet assistant told us they wouldn't give him to us. They insisted keeping him. I am currently a vet tech student and its against the law for animal hospitals to keep the animal from the family if they decide to deny care for them at the facility. So they kept insisting keeping him and offered us to put him down. Which costed us more money. Another $750 so they can sedate and put him to sleep.  After waiting a whole  8 hours of the situation, the decision was made to put him to sleep. ( which we could have done somewhere else that was cheaper). It was until 5:30pm we said our last goodbyes to our dog. Anyways, this place only wants you for the money. They do not care about the animals here. We wanted to take him somewhere else but they insisted keeping him (which is illegal if the owner wants the animal back). We also came to bring a stray cat today  because he has a patch of skin off from his left side off. You can see the cats flesh muscles. It looks really bad. We called to check the cat in and they said they will be out to check him. We waited for 45mins and seen the vet assistants avoiding our car (that was there first before any other cars arrived) and they never came to see the cats condition. Which I thought was very wrong because vet hospitals should care for the animals as their slogan says. So we left and came to a different animal hospital on Washington St. Upon arrival, They gladly gave us the paperwork right away and check the cat in ( which we only paid $60 than paying $250 on Jefferson Animal hospital.) Overall, I hope you guys fix your system. Its uncalled for to charge ridiculous amount of money to help and care for animals. Definitely not returning or bringing any animals to this "emergency animal hospital".</Review>< pictures>

I do not like to write negative reviews, yet this place deserves it. I had the unfortunate experience of having to come here daily then every other day for a long time, I spoke with most their staff and I agree with other reviewers. There are plenty of reasons to be completely outraged and upset with the staff there. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money here which is all they care about anyway.

- Expect to wait long hours. I would take my dog for bandage changes 8-9 hours became normal, poor guy in a metal kennel all day for a 15 minute procedure.

- One doctor asked me what antibiotics my dog was on and I quote him "So I don't have to read his paperwork." Then went on to say we need to do cultures which we already did do. Hope you don't get that doctor.

- Doctor Boyd is completely awful. She kept my dog there all day and then refused to change his bandages and put a catheter in for his uti, his bladder was completely full when I picked him up. All she wanted to do is euthanize when I refused she told me I can't come back to this hospital any longer. She doesn't believe dogs in wheelchairs have quality of life. Apparently no one else is capable of putting a simple catheter in a dog but them and she told me to bring my dog in 2-4 times a day with a $97 charge each time.
We're pretty sure this is the same doctor who over a year ago told us our little dog has cancer and he won't make it through the night, let alone to san diego vca the next day. Complete misdiagnosis and shame on her for putting us in such a state of fear. He's still alive today. NO signs of cancer and in perfect health. Good thing we didn't listen to her ridiculous urging of euthanasia. Can't help but wonder how many poor others received false information.

- They told me my dogs wounds would never heal, well they did. They said he would never pee on his own, well he did.

- Their manager will NEVER call you back - they simply don't care. As other reviewers have said. If one of their doctors treats you badly you'll have no one to speak to about it.

- God forbid you have an issue with insurance, they will NOT help you. Evelyn who manages insurance told their staff she called me and talked about it, when she never bothered. You will not receive their help for claims.

- Juan and Dr Gilabert are good people. In my experience there, he was one of the two only techs willing to talk to people and answer their questions.
Others rarely ever said hello let alone welcomed your questions.

They're busy because they're the only emergency hospital here, everyone I know dreads coming here with good reason.
They'll blame covid for their staffs behavior but sadly they've always been like this.
Other vets here will recommend vca ontario as a much better emergency option.
Vca San Diego is absolutely amazing and their entire staff will treat you wonderfully. VCA valley leaves a very bad impression on the vca brand.

As for here expect the worst and get a second opinion, they've been wrong too many times.</review>

Great help from the vets during a scary time with my dog. The receptionist at night were a bit harder to get to pass messages and left me on hold for a long time forgetting  I was waiting but my overall experience with the care for my dog was amazing. The vet and surgeon called me consistently with updates and answered any questions  I had. The vet even called me a week after having my fur baby home to check on her progress and answer  anything new questions I may hav for her home care. . I'm super thankfulüôÇ<//text>

<review>I sadly bought a puppy from a breeder that ended up having problems. I bring her one day to this hospital they gave us 2 medications and an IV. Charged $300. Two days later our puppy declines after taking anti-parasitic meds they gave us so I make an emergency visit, I told them all I can afford is the visit please just tell me if there‚Äôs anything I can do about her medication regime. They say she‚Äôs really bad and running tests is gonna start in the thousands.  I said I can‚Äôt afford it. They said your next option is to open a credit card or euthanatize her. I asked can i take her to get treated elsewhere like Mexicali they said sure but we have to report it to Animal Control for negligence. Thanks for literally nothing<//review>< Pics>

<review>Dr Gilabert cared for our dog "Tess"   after she was attacked by a puppy. She did emergency surgery  and she was there over night.
Dr Gilabert did a great job, we are unable to find the scar where she operated three weeks later.  Tess is back 100%  Eating, playing, running and one would never know what she endured thanks to this wonderful, caring, kind vet.     Thanks again ,

<review>While their Covid protocol is in place, the rest of this facility is a mess. They over charge and care for you depending on your willingness to except that over charge. The phones and staff service are a joke. They will rattle off anything to get to the next call, even after you wait and were told you would be speaking to a doctor. After your long wait, the doctor is suddenly too busy I highly recommend you find another place to take your  beloved animal for proper care.< /review>< UserId.>

<text>If I had to sum up this facility in two words they would be: Absolutely horrendous. The staff here are unprofessional and dishonest people that only care about the bottom line.

When we arrived we were told that we were lucky that there were no other animals there and they could get my dog in for surgery right away (she was bleeding heavily from several puncture wounds caused by another dog).

They originally quoted us $4,000 for a wide variety of things that were unnecessary but we requested that they stitch my dog up and give her pain medication and antibiotics.

They then quoted us $2,000 claiming that the reason for the additional cost is for the 6 hour wait time caused by another surgery being done (which was a lie because there was no other animals there). We told them that was outrageous and we weren't going to be lied to.

We were then placed on hold for an additional 10 minutes while they adjusted the figures on their estimate and when they gave us the final estimate we were quoted THE SAME AMOUNT $2,000 but this time for only 2 hours of waiting. When I told her that was the same exact amount she quoted me before, she said "I can show you the receipt if you'd like".

We declined care after realizing they were horrendous people who were only concerned with squeezing out an extra $1,000 from a wounded animal and a family in despair. These people are providing a necessary service but they are absolutely disgusting and untrustworthy.

These sorts of business practices are illegal everywhere but health care it seems, they should be fined heavily and be put under investigation for their predatory practices.<//text>< pictures>

What started out as a horrible experience with Dr Juu has turned out to be exceptional with Dr Trousdale and his team . Our Ollie dog who is a dachshund is experiencing paralysis in his back legs . Unfortunately surgery was not able to be done as they could not locate a disc that needed operating üò¢ but nonetheless Ollie has received top notch service.

<Text>I called about my dog yesterday (who is in obvious pain) and VCA Valley Animal Medical Center Emergency Hospital said to bring him in this morning.  I drove 40 minutes, parked, and then waited 10 minutes on hold after calling them from the car as instructed.  They again asked me my dogs symptoms and I told them the same thing I told them yesterday.  To my utter amazement VCA refused to see my dog, and told me to go elsewhere.

These people are unprofessional to the extreme, and should be avoided if at all possible.<//Text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Thank you Dr. Boyd for taking Ruger under your care and taking the time to ask questions and explain his medical situations to me, pros and cons,  with honesty. The caring medical attention Ruger and I received from Dr. Boyd was outstanding.</Review>

<Review>Took my puppy in with Parvovirus. They took my dog back and he sat there for hours without treatment due to payment and the fact that the doctor took five hours to get back to me to tell me the treatment that my animal needed and how much it was going to cost. Sent my daughter down with $700 that is seven $100 bills my bill was $604. Took my puppy in with Parville. They took my dog back and he sat there for hours without treatment due to payment and the fact that the doctor took five hours to get back to me to tell me the treatment that my animal needed and how much it was going to cost. Sent my daughter down with $700 that is seven $100 bills my bill was $604.45 the change I received back was $75.55 the change I was due back was $95.55. That is a $20. Difference. On top of Ripping me off for $20 they brought my puppy out to me along with the bag with the two IVs and his prescriptions and my paperwork and handed it to me just like that no instructions whatsoever on what to do. Thank GOD for YouTube!!! I had to look up on my own how to administer fluids under the skin on my puppy üê∂. Needless to say I will never go there again and I advise anyone never if you love your animal do not take them to this hospital!!!

Oh yes and before the owner or manager or whatever tries to respond and use the Covid virus excuse save it because you people can spread that virus all over the place with the your work ethics!!<//Review><Time>1602783149142</Time><gmapID>0x80daf85228e4e75f:0xf3c0302ed6b3c63c<//gmapID><rate>1</rate>< resp>

<Text>I waited in the parking lot with my sister with her cat for seven hours.  The doctor called my phone as I sat in the car and asked my decision.  I asked what she was talking about.  Two hours earlier i told them to take the blood work.  After 7 hours they brought the cat back and said they couldn't take the blood from the cat because she was too unsettled.  This is after a 7 hour weight on a 5 lb kitty.  They had me bring her back in tme morning to draw the blood and 2 days later we are wairing on the tsh thryoid test.   Poor service.  Unprofessional.  Unreliable.    They should be investigated and put out of business.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< name>

We had to come here for an after hours emergency, after a poor experience at Banfield. From their COVID-19 procedures, to the receptionist to the techs and vet we had a really wonderful experience. We felt informed, taken care of, and trusting. The vet explained what was going on very clearly and spent time answering our questions. The reception and techs were also kind and patient. We will be making them our primary vet when in Palm Desert. Thank you for caring for our little animal!</Text>

<review>I've been here twice over the years, both times in the middle of the night.

Both times the dog ate something it shouldn't have.

Both times the service was wonderful at VCA in Indio.

One time they induced vomiting and it was expensive... but where else will you turn at midnight when you're pet's life may be at risk?

Tonight, the dog ate insect poison. When I arrived - the staff insisted that I called animal poison control.

At first, I was a bit miffed and just wanted them to make the dog throw up.

Now I understand they did me a favor.

Poison control confirmed the dog was in no danger from the amount ingested, and I saved what could have been a couple hundred dollar vet bill.

If this happens to you, consider making a donation to VCA instead :-)< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9_agcKbgh8-J-MOUGMgpPT7Xx2WGxjHwSXTd-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

<text>I brought in a stray dog that I saw get attacked by a vicious German Sheppard.  She was severely injured.  Huge gaping tear in her neck.  This 24 hour hospital got her in very quickly despite the fact they were busy. The doctor, Dr Rick Klomhaus was incredible.  He took the time to explain all the options and did his best to keep the cost down knowing that this was just a stray and was not even my dog. However, I took financial responsibility for her and I'm so glad that I did. Some people think the costs are too high here but you have to keep in mind it's an emergency hospital. These people are working around-the-clock. And I can't speak for everyone but the staff there that I dealt with were very compassionate and responsive. I have 2 dogs at home that I will now start taking to Dr Klomhaus.  Happy ending, the little husky I found that was torn apart from this German shepherd is doing very well. And I have found a safe home for her. All is well because of this hospital and wonderful doctor and staff.< /text>< Date>

Took my dog in at 3am and was admitted promptly, due to COVID-19 I was unable to enter with my dog. I was provided with an estimate and agreed. 10 minutes later I called back and asked to hold off on X-rays until we discerned whether iv hydration was working. I was informed the X-rays had already been done (over $500). I‚Äôve never seen a vet at this clinic work that fast. Then I was shamed by the vet for not authorizing the radiologist fees to read the X-rays. I wanted to proceed reasonably.  Upon picking up my dog and handed the instructions the next day and after being home an additional day I phoned them as he had not improved. I had questions about everything. I was told a doc would get back to me. I assumed that day.  I finally called the next after that. The reception answered the phone like this ‚Äúvcaanimalhospitalisthisanemergencypleadehold!!!!!‚Äù  I said it‚Äôs not an emergency if that‚Äôs what you just asked.‚Äù Frantically she repeated the same thing. It was actually rude. I was placed on hold 5 minutes. When she came back I asked to speak with a vet about follow up from the 3am visit and the previous days call with questions. I was placed on hold. 30 minutes later I hung up. I called back and got the same frantic receptionist. Dismissively,  I was told vets follow up with questions in 48-72 hours. It‚Äôs been 6 days and at 7:54pm I just got a voicemail from them that they are ‚Äúvery concerned‚Äù on how my dog is doing. NEVER take your animal to VCA Indio. This is unfortunately not my first experience with their horrible communication and follow up along with unnecessary and borderline deceptive cost communication practices when I questioned that speedy xray. But, it is now my last time going to this emergency clinic.  I have found an excellent vet in Palm Desert with wonderful communication, explained fees and quick follow up. It‚Äôs too bad this company is the only 24 emergency in town. Perhaps they don‚Äôt care because of that. $2000 later and a stressful HORRENDOUS Experience.

*** in response to their response below of my review:

It‚Äôs fascinating to me that a veterinarian doctor cannot call a fearful client with a sick pet back within 6 days from a $2000 paid vet visit. But, the clinic can post a heartfelt response to my google public review promptly within 8 hours.<//Review>

<Text>This was the worst experience I've ever had at a vet hospital.  My cat went in with a fever and dehydrated she sat their for 10 hours with no antibiotics and no fluids till I ask for them and picked up and brought her home. They gave me no diagnosis until 2 weeks later they called with a uti diagnosis which I had already got from a vet friend of my the next day after I brought her home. High on billing very low on competence.  Next time I have an emergency I will go out of this valley to the next emergency hospital.

Our cat Bumble Bee's paw was bleeding profusely. It turned out to be a nasty bite. The staff cleaned her up and placed a little cast on her. We waited for a while in the reception, but that's to be expected in an emergency situation. Everyone was quite caring, despite our cat being a little crazy. A good result!</Text>

If you are thinking about taking out a loan on your vehicle title or a second mortgage go ahead and use this clinic. If you are like me and don't like either of those options then go somewhere else, anywhere else! $480 just for an x-ray and another $590 for an ultrasound they didn't even read cause they don't have a specialist on site with another $200 just for iv fluids. After $1500 and quoted another $7k for a surgery I went for a second opinion with total cost less than a third of VCA if we do surgery. Right now doing water in fluids since a surgery may be avoidable.</text>

<Review>Brought cat in for checkup only.

Don't bring pets after 4, they'll hold them until 6 to charge you the overnight stay. Given my information clearly, they completely ignored it as none of my contact information was right, and if I didn't contact them again there's no telling what could have happened. Waiting outside to pickup my cat now, Have been waiting for 15 minutes. Terrible place, terrible customer service. Wouldn't recommend.< /Review>< user_name>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>I have had the misfortune to visit this Animal Hospital on 2 occasions in the past due to middle of the night emergencies with my little 2 pound Yorkie puppy. My first visit was because my puppy had Aspiration Pneumonia and the second time she was hyperglycemic and had fainted on me. During my first visit I came at 2 am because my puppy sounded like she was about to cough up a lung and I was accepted in, after paying $800 in order for them to do an x-ray, the vet doctor that was working with me was very harsh with her language and described what my puppy was dealing with as near death, which scared me to the point of crying...  and then I was presented with another $1,800 invoice to pay for her treatment. I don't live in the area as I was visiting my parents and needed to return home the next day (Sunday) and asked if the treatment can wait until I am back home with my regular vet. Of course the vet made it sound as though waiting was not an option. I had to pay $1,800 before they would officially admit her for services they weren't sure she would need. The next day (Sunday) I was called by another vet, who told me that my puppy was good to go home and that I just needed to give her antibiotics every day and perform steam inhalations for 10 minutes a day for 10 days or so.. Later when I took her to her normal vet he explained to me that my puppy was OK and that the aspiration pneumonia should not have been that big of a scare for me and didn't need to be made into such a big hospital stay.
A couple months later I drove with my puppy from Los Angeles to the Desert and after being at my parents house for an hour and my puppy walking around and being normal I found her laying down with a limp body and just whining to me as if she was crying for help. I called the breeder immediately as she has Yorkie's (obviously) and told me that she will always help if a situation with the puppies health arises. She immediately thought that the puppy either was hyperglycemic or hit hear head. I immediately gave her maple syrup on her gums as I was instructed and tried to warm her up and head to this VCA immediately because the condition was not improving. This was once again in the night time hours and upon arrival they took my puppy immediately, however they took my creditcard to pay for blood tests and IV liquids.
Later, while I waited the vet came into the waiting room, same vet as before, and proceeded to be very rude when I asked her to speak to the breeder, who was still on the phone trying to help me and was going to explain to me what the vet said. My breeder was telling me suggestions on how to proceed, but the Vet said that I would have to fork up $5,000 before they would do any tests, that the puppy needed x-rays, blood tests, and to stay for observation for the next 24 hours and also needed medication to be paid for.
I was crying and I didn't have that type of money to spend on things they weren't guaranteeing would be needed, I called my parents to see if they could help, but the vet would not accept a credit card over the phone from my parents.
Finally, the manager that was on that night came to speak with me and told me that I could see my puppy and that she was doing better. When my puppy came out she was herself again. The manager told me that in her opinion, my puppy would not need all the crazy tests and medications that the vet was suggesting performing and that, as I thought my puppy was in hyperglycemia and just needed more time to come back to herself. So I followed my gut on trusting that and seeing that my puppy was behaving normal again and took her home. I had to pay in the end $500 for the blood tests, oxygen tank, and IVY fluids.

I would not recommend this place to anyone.. They only think about how much money they can charge you! The vet doctors are rude, they over charge for everything and they will let you pet die in front of them if you don't pay the full price immediately for services they may not need to perform.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>This place consistently charges exorbitant prices. Our lab had a swollen foot. After examining our dog they came back with an estimate of $800-$1000 dollars and would take 2-3 hours. The x-ray was going to cost $225, with another $175 for a "radiologist' to interpret the x-ray and $75 for an injection to "calm" our  lab down for the x-ray plus at least $200 for medications. We instead called a friend and went to her vet in El Paseo. We were done in 1 hour. The x-ray was $150 which the vet expertly interpreted without the help of a "radiologist". There was no injection necessary for their exam or x-ray. The medications were $65 and the exam by the vet was $65. VCA overcharges exorbitantly and plays on your desire to get your pet well. I would not recommend them unless they are the only place available and it is a dire emergency, but expect to pay unreasonable amounts.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>My goodness this place is terrible! The front desk staff is wonderful, and so was the vet tech who came out to get our pet. But holy cow, we had a very sick puppy who was puking and had diarrhea, we sat in our vehicle for 2 hours before they came and got her. They kept telling us someone was heading out to get her, after 30 minutes we would call, someone else was on their way out here. 30 minutes would pass and again no one came and got her, she was completely miserable and lethargic. We were expecting she would obviously need fluids and some medication, but we weren't expecting a $3000 vet bill. Dr. Foot's assistant was what made the whole experience 10x more stressful. We were already worried about our family pet, but her extreme rudeness was sickening. To think we couldn't be with our sick puppy, and she was stuck with care from such a heartless person caring for her. When I called to talk about the treatment plan for the second time (because she hung up on me the first time), she was extremely rude, and short. I tried very hard to be patient and understanding because of the current circumstances, but this has been the absolute worst experience from a vet office/hospital.

I believe if our poor pup didn't have to wait multiple hours to recieve treatment she would still be with us today. She was brought out to us in worse condition than she went in with. We get home, I gave her, her meds, and I called the assistant to ask if we should bring her back because she was getting worse.  She reassured me that she was fine,  she had a long day and needed rest. 2 hours later as my 3 kids were laying by her, she passed away.

If i knew all this would happen the way it did, I would have kept her home, instead of her being tortured by this place.< /Review>< Pictures>

I don't know why this place has so many bad reviews. I had to take my cat in a little over 2 years ago and they were straight up with me and told me what I already knew, that I had to put my precious baby to sleep. The staff was extremely kind and caring and let me hold him while he passed. A few days later I got a card in the mail signed by everyone who worked there offering their condolences. Two days ago I took my dog to my regular vet and they basically said that he needed to be put down. So we took him to VCA in Indio yesterday and they said what he has is common and can be fixed with surgery. Everyone from the front office staff to the vet assistant and the doctor himself were nothing but stellar. No, they're not cheap but I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for. And these people are worth it!! Thank you VCA for understanding my situation and helping me in my times of need.< /Review>

<review>One star is too many. We brought our dog in after her hind legs stopped working. We had a curbside appt, and Dr. Gilabert called me a couple of hours later to let me know that our dog had the option of a $5000 surgery, acupuncture 3 hrs away 3x a week, or euthanasia. She talked with me about our options, and said she would call the neurologist and get right back to me. An hour and a half later I still hadn‚Äôt heard from her and my dog was still inside. I called back and she wasn‚Äôt available, hadn‚Äôt gotten in touch with anyone, and hadn‚Äôt let me know anything. Just went onto the next patient and was done with us. I asked to take my dog home and for her to please call me when she was available. I haven‚Äôt heard from her. This is an emergency situation where our dog becomes more paralyzed by the day, and we got half an appointment and Dr. Gilabert wouldn‚Äôt even return a phone call. We are now basically watching our dog die in our living room and we can‚Äôt even get our call returned.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1595347683731, 'text': "Lou, we're sorry to read of the inconvenience you experienced.

< Review>
Knowing only that my cat, Chester, was in serious distress, I took him to VCA as an emergency. It was quite busy, therefore a bit of a wait and it took a few tries to get through to let them know we'd arrived.  Considering the volume of patients they had, I still feel we were dealt with in a timely manner. (A staff member even brought cold bottled water out for those of us waiting in parking lot.) The staff that I had interactions with and those I observed were all professional and caring. And as busy as they were - they LISTENED.
Dr. Klomhaus - himself - called me and explained the issue and the gravity of the situation.  He was straightforward with his questions, explanations and suggestions. I know that it mattered to him that I understood, and I appreciate that more than I can say.
I was very worried about the fact that I knew that this was going to cost more than I had, and I let them know right away. Instead of turning us away, Dr.Klomhaus gave me a (deeply) discounted bill and Chester came home with the medicine and prescription food that he needed.
I thank God for Dr.Klomhaus and thank Dr.Klomhaus and crew for saving my cat.</Review>

I took my chihuahua here because we feared something was stuck in his food pipe. When they took him in they called us many times updating on his situation and telling us what what was going which relieved the stress :). Turns out he had an infection from swallowing something too big and he finished his medicine yesterday and is completely healed and happy! Sorry JoJo was not in the best mood that day though hehe.<//Text>

If I could I would give this whole animal hospital no stars as my dog was sick and didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with him. I took my dog to this animal hospital to have him checked they told me to bring him in when I called. my wife and I drove all the way from 29 palms to them and when we got there they turned us away, hung up on us and didn‚Äôt bother to help. my dog passed away that same night. That was on May 1st 2020 at 11:58pm. Oh and charged my wife and I $205 to have our dog cremated.<//Review>

I took my cat Busik there because my vet wanted me to take him to see a specialist.
I am still confused about this place. Is it an Emergency hospital where real specialists can see your pet and you can get a second opinion? I am not sure. I was giving three options on how to proceed. Admit him into clinic for more tests, for around $7000, keep treating him with same meds or put him down. I chose to continue to treat him. I was giving a bill that included an oxygen treatment for my cat that didn't have any breathing problems. Most importantly I was there for almost six hours. Why? I still can't understand why I went there...I am sure they have great doctors and stuff...but to me it was not necessary trip and pretty much wasted time.< /review>

My girl sophie got ran over last week we called them they told us they would be waiting for us. Sadly my girl passed on the way to the vet. When we arrived they took her in and where very kind and respectful. They prepared a room and let us say our goodbyes to our baby. They where nothing but kind. They told us our options and took care of everything for us. Yes they are pricey but that‚Äôs the normal fees to an emergency vet who is open 24 hrs. So thank you VCA for helping us with our Sophie. We really appreciate all you guys did for us that night.</Review>

I brought my 6 month old Siberian Husky here because he was bloated which they told me he had liver failure. They told us we could either give him a $5,000 surgery which doesn‚Äôt always work or put him down :( I was devastated because we didn‚Äôt have enough money for the surgery. We almost put him down but we first searched for other options. We started putting him on a diet of only cooked ground meat and now he‚Äôs back to normal and is 1 years old. We keep his diet the same with a tiny bit of carrots and sometimes other good things because sometimes he gets a little bit bloated but other then that we have our baby back to normal :)</text>

Our Australian Cattle Dog pup became terribly ill one day two months after we had received her. We thought Arya had choked on a rawhide chew bone, but through exhaustive testing and two plasma transfusions Indio VCA Hospital brought her back to life.

Yesterday (4/16/2020) I called at 10:57am and spoke with a female regarding my 6 month old puppy‚Äôs last set of her very first vaccinations, which included rabies. Not booster shots. The original appointment was postponed due to the corona virus.  I asked if I could bring my puppy (LuLu Bear) in as a walk-in since they were only taking walk-in‚Äôs and emergencies...at first she said no thinking it was a dog needing a booster but  then realized it was my puppy‚Äôs first shots and stated they were very important and please come for a walk in visit and how important the vaccines were for my puppy‚Äôs health. At 2:41pm I arrived in Indio from Rancho mirage with my puppy and called them from parking per their request for virus protection protocol.  Spoke to Britney who was to say nicely, VERY rude.  She stated my puppy could go 8 months without last vaccines and was extremely pushy speaking down to me and throwing me on hold...when I tried to ask questions I got shut down and told I was wrong about the information I was given on the earlier call.  So, I was lying?  What??   Is Britney even qualified to answer questions regarding medical care?  Shouldn‚Äôt a vet tech been asked or a vet?  Luckily on the vets office phone line Is a wonderful recording right before you speak to someone...the recording states: recorded for quality assurance and training.  I hope management will pull these two calls: 4/16/2020 10:57 am and 2:41pm 5 and 6 minutes long.  We have spent thousands of dollars in our animals there and drive out of the way to use their office and get treated like this?   Never again and won‚Äôt refer anyone. Please coach this receptionist on manners.

One bad day and a thousand good ones with this place doesn‚Äôt deserve a review like I gave.  Apologies for not editing it sooner... As parents we all get a little over emotional when our babies are in need of help. Although I do believe the customer service needed some work everything else about them is perfect everybody has enough day hang in there you guys are doing great. Thanks for everything!<//Text>

Stray cat came to our house, very wounded! Possibly hit by a car or attacked. Terrible to see, called Valley VCA they said to come down. Upon arrival they rushed out and took the cat back for assessment. Unfortunately kitty was too injured to repair and recommended putting him down. All in all, they were very attentive and said it would be covered by the county! So glad they could help him find peace! Thank you to all the staff for all they do!</text>

<Review>Took our dog today. He has a cough and we knew it could be contagious so we voluntarily stayed outside. They were very attentive when taking our info then we sat for 3.5 hours. Finally they took us to what they called the infectious disease room. Which considering the name you would expect to smell like disinfectant. It wasnt even that clean. Footprints in dirt on the floor. Needless to say they were nice but the dr says she wants to do xrays we ask how much she tells us the receptionist will be in with the details but that they did have care credit we could apply for. She said it would be the bare minimum of xrays. The receptionist comes in and says dr wants xray of chest and throat and has meds to start on baring outcome of xrays. Then with a straight face says it will cost $800.  I said you must be out of your mind. We asked how much we owed for exam were told $72.50 or there abouts. So my boyfriend was very upset to begin with its his baby. So he wasnt in the mood to wait more just to pay these people. So he pjaced $70 on the counter told them name of our dog and left. Then as we are pulling out one of the people that work there had come running out to the car saying we still owed $2.50... Really? So he put $5 in her han d and said keep the change which she gladly did.... Never will i step foot anywhere near this place or tell anyone else to. I would rather drive to san bernardino to find an emergency vet.  HOW DO YOU PEOPLE SLEEP AT NIGHT... I can get xrays for myself for less then 800... All i was thinking on the way out was these poor people waiting they have no idea.  Dont bother answering there is nothing you can say that makes any of it ok. You just thought you could squeeze $800 out of another couple of people that were obviously concerned about their pet.. Shame on you.<//Review>< Response>

Unable to leave a comment without giving them a star. Doesn‚Äôt deserve one star ‚≠êÔ∏è

Took my dog to this clinic for his leg, waited over an hour.

They never took my dogs vitals , when asked about why such a long wait. The answer was we only have one doctor and he‚Äôs busy.

Another customer that came in 35 minutes after I arrived with her dog in a soft crate an the tech took her into a room immediately.

After waiting so long, I inquired if there were any other emergency vets near by.

The assistant said she didn‚Äôt know.

They weren‚Äôt to concerned when I said I was leaving.

Not especially pleased with this clinic.

Beware!!!!!<//Review>

<text>The amount of money they charge and the service they give is unbelievable. Like many of these reviews VCA is strictly focused on Money. They preformed X-ray when we told them our dog had xrays two days prior. They preform and ultrasound and charged us $2600 flat. Couple hours later the vet looked at us strait in the face and said. I DONT KNOW WHATS WRONG. Then started asking us questions that relate to bronchitis. Although would not confirm only assume.  I have never in my life felt so taking of advantage. My wife is crying and they look at me and hand me a deposit slip for $2600 and could possibly go up to $3800. Well guess what still no definitive answer but they want another 24 hr treatment plan for $1300.  If you cannot give any info about the Expensive procedure they ask you to do. I cannot see how they can charge.  I have no problem paying for good service but goodness. We have been to three vets. $232 $1000 & $2400 none could diagnose our 1.5 year old weenie I pray god has mercy on the people behind the scenes that come up with these medical markups.<//text></record>

Gloria is the best part of our otherwise anxiety-driven experience.

The vet, by contrast, is clearly and understandably stressed out during these emergency hours, but she crossed the line by not wanting to listen to our request for a certain treatment and what followed. We get it, she‚Äôs the doctor so we listen to her authority. However we think our request for a certain treatment seemed to inflame her already stressed state. She stormed out of the room, kept us waiting for an hour, then returned with a laundry list of unnecessary and expensive tests etc. It seems like she may eat her feelings instead of talking and processing them. Hence, she wouldnt let us talk either. What would it be like to be her child? Not being able to express an opinion...

Without going into specifics, our pet is happy, healthy, and needed some preventative treatment for a minor injury.

Again, Gloria saved our experience. She appears to be a tech, front counter worker, and all around general manager and peace keeper - generally keeping it all running.  She is soothing while the vet is stress-provoking.< /review>

<Review>Took my lethargic 14 year old dog here. Tried to figure out what was wrong and took many tests. Day after day we got checkups  expecting  to find out what was wrong. We came back home with nothing. They said we would have to take things to the next step and charge us for more tests. Money was their first priority.  We wanted to hear from another vet and see what their point of view was. They said he's just at an old age and it's time to go.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80daf85228e4e75f:0xf3c0302ed6b3c63c<//gmap_id>< response>

We took in our Pit Bull Terrier after she had been attacked by our other dog which left her a wound on her neck that looked inflamed. When we took her in, the vet (Kristi Medearis) came in and began to explain to us what she found/assumed she found. She went through the options. She told my mother and I that she recommended surgery to go in and check out the wound because there might be separation of skin from fat/muscle, or something along those lines, or that she could euthanize the dog. When she suggested we could euthanize her, she said it with a casualness that showed no empathy or compassion for our pet or for how afraid we were. The offer for euthanasia was given before she even knew what was truly wrong with her. The operation was estimated to be around two to three thousand dollars, something we could not afford so we opted to simply take antibiotics for her and hope for the best at home, given the circumstances. Before she was brought out to us, they said they had wrapped her neck with something to protect it and charged us almost forty dollars for gauze and self-adhering wrap. It's been a week and a day and Raven (our dog) is healing well, her neck no longer swollen and the bite only a scab now. She still has scabs where they shaved her neck, and we can only assume they shaved her haphazardly, with indifference and/or lack of skill. All in all, the place is only there for the money. They do not try to work with the human of the animal with payment plans unless you qualify for CareCredit. If you have an emergency and absolutely need a twenty-four hour vet, then go ahead, but don't come here if you don't have to. Their push for x-rays and bloodwork and other things seems manipulative and unnecessary, a ploy to get more money. They don't care for the animal -- money is their only concern.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Two months ago, my terrier mix was bitten by a Green Mojave Rattlesnake.  We arrived at VCA in Indio at 1am and they rushed Elmer to the treatment room. He was near death and I was given no false hope by the staff. All of his systems and organs were crashing. I never felt pressured from anyone at VCA to pursue treatment. If fact, one vet sympathetically told me that, even though Elmer's part of my family, treatment would be costly and even if the dog survived, there were quality of life issues to consider after a snakebite. I appreciated his frankness.

I pretty much said my goodbyes to Elmer during the one hour drive to the hospital, but for my own peace of mind, I decided to give him one round of antivenom just so that I could say I gave him a fighting chance. He's one tough dog. Although he was in a coma, his blood work showed marked improvement after the first treatment so we gave him another, then another. He remained in critical care for 5 days and to my delight and amazement, I was able to bring him home. He was very sick but has continued to show improvement every day. He has assumed his role as the boss of the pack and is even playing with the puppy. Most importantly, he's happy.

The doctors were kind and understanding during this stressful period and allowed me to spend time with Elmer in the treatment area. The technicians were supportive and professional and I felt like they were all pulling for my dog to survive. Even the cleaning lady came up to us during a follow up visit and greeted Elmer by name.

I'm grateful that my experience had a good outcome and I'm dismayed by some of the negative reviews. We had to wait a couple of hours for a follow up visit, which was frustrating, but I realize that some others may have been made to wait while the technicians were all working on my dog during those first few critical hours. Health care is expensive for animals, too.  I never felt like they were putting money before my dog's well being. Multiple antivenom treatments, blood transfusions, medications and around the clock critical care by well-educated professionals is expensive. VCA was upfront about the costs and I'll be paying this off for a while, but I'm so thankful that they were there when I needed them.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1572362119410, 'text': "Johnny, we know this had been quite the stressful situation and we're grateful that we could be of service to Elmer who we're very proud of for getting through this obstacle.

On April 30, I took my little chihuahua, after examine her the veterinarian told me she didn't know what was the problem, she ordered x-rays,  blood and urine work to find out what the problem was, after running all tests she came back and kept telling me she still didn't know what the problem was because everything looks ok and told me to better bring her to a specialist but I should keep my dog with them in case she need it more oxygen. I paid a lot for the tests and when she suggested leaving my pet overnight I realized she was there only to drain the money out of you without giving you any reassurance your pet will make it. I took my chances and took my pet back home with me, worst night ever waiting for her regular veterinarian's office open, thankfully she made it and as soon as we arrived they started caring for her  after seeing the blood work results turned out she had an infection which was causing her seizures which was missed by VCA veterinarian<//review>

<review>This the worst place in the Desert. Doctor Salk was the best Doctor. At Palm Springs Animal Hospital, Palm Springs Animal Hospital is the best.  VCA hospital in Indio and Palm Springs, only care about how much money to jab you with,AND  the wait was awful, almost a whole day and had taken most of the day from my job, forget about doing this on your lunch hour.  BAD SERVICE  They ,DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR PET,ONLY ABOUT MONEY

The Director does not know how to care for pets, somebody needs to replace him and have HIS dog get sick and see how depressing this is, he makes it worse for the pets</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

$ the money more important than helping my little baby dog  I was prepared to pay a lot for my dog, but the estimated cost were outrageous. Clearly taking advantage of the situation rather than helping my dog.

Shame on you VCA. I am withdrawing my original 5 star rating and giving you only 1. My Mother-In-Law paid for the private cremation of our beloved cat Dixon over the phone, the DAY OF SERVICE with her credit card and you sent the amount to COLLECTIONS??? You stated that I disputed the charge and that's why you sent it to a scummy collection agency??? I sincerely hope the ghosts of Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Sadam Hussain, and Bin Laden haunt your dreams on a nightly basis.

EDIT: Turns out that there was a charge back to my M.I.L's Credit Card, as she closed and cancelled the card due to suspicious activity. However, VCA still sent the outstanding balance to a collection agency without even attempting to make contact with me to pay what was owed. I am upping to 3 stars for their wonderful care and attention and support to my beloved cat Dixon, but their billing department sucks., and I will stand by my last sentence in above review...but just for their billing department.</Text>

< review>
We recently went through a gut wrenching experience that emotionally hit us hard. Our Sasha was diagnosed with cancer, Melanoma. She wasn't in pain but the location of the tumor we could see was making it difficult for her to eat. She was very anemic and losing weight. The doctor said she may go within a week. A friend suggested CBD Oil for dogs. We tried this and she responded well but the inevitable reared it's ugly head and 2 and a half months later events lead us have to bring her in to say good-bye. I really felt bad for the Dr. who had to come in for the process of shots, my appreciation for the job you do that I could never do and kindness and understanding while we were grieving is very appreciated. The staff were so compassionate during this time when our family was emotionally down. We chose to have her cremated and keep her remains. It's tough to ask for money but this is a piece of the puzzle. I paid that day and less than 2 weeks later my daughter got the call they were ready. We received a very nice box, my wife already bought an urn but the box the remains were provided in is really nice. They provided a paw print of our beloved Sasha and yeah the tears started again. Our family cannot thank you enough the kindness we received from everyone.<//review>

So far it's as bad as I thought it would be. The tech took appart my cat carrier and it is now missing screws. And then some woman comes out and starts VACUUMING the waiting area! Seriously? I have a very sick and nervous cat, as do other people waiting, and this idiot thinks it's a good idea to use a VACUUM?? All this and I haven't even seen the Dr yet. I recommend just going out to thousand palms aspca. They are much more  knowledgeable and caring than these people. I would ONLY recommend this establishment for absolute emergencies. Update:bring a snack, I have been here for two hours! The lobby has filled and emptied TWICE and I am still waiting!</text>

<text>We brought in our pet for diagnosis and paid the 69.75 fee, and left with and untreated pet and an estimate for treatment that soared in to the thousands ($4800-$6100).

Folks, do yourself a favor and get a second opinion if you have the time. The process at VCA is this: they size you up and then shake you down. I don‚Äôt know if they use demographics when determining the ‚Äúestimates‚Äù, or possibly an algorithm that has to do with addresses and median incomes, but something is very off at VCA. It truly feels like the Route 66, middle of nowhere, mechanic... they know they are your only option. It‚Äôs a ‚ÄúHow much money do you have?‚Äù kind of shake down. Only it is worse than that, as we are talking about life and death decisions for our pets.

We did get treatment for our sick pet elsewhere... It turns out VCA misdiagnosed our pet.  Had we not refused treatment there, our pet would have had an unnecessary surgery and possible complications or fatality as a result.

The many sad reviews and stories posted here are a testament to a huge opportunity for a caring and trust-worthy veterinarian to open up a 24-hour animal hospital in the Coachella Valley.</text>< pics>

I don't usually bother writing these reviews but after looking at so many negative comments I felt compelled to do this.
Over the past week our shepherd cross developed serious health problems. She was an older, rescue dog who lived a wonderful life but sadly we had to let her leave us this past Monday.
We had two visits to this clinic and each time all of the staff and doctors were absolutely outstanding in terms of professional care, compassion and empathy, and clearly went out of their way to assist us in any way possible.
I am a health professional myself so totally related to their approach and cannot say enough about how grateful we were for their help at this sad time.<//review>

This by far was the worst animal hospital I have been too The Dr. was very rude and had no idea what she was talking about not even sure if she had a real license. The staff has nice but that does not make up for the incompetent DR. Had to take our puppy to a real Doctor at desert dunes animal hospital the next day. The doctor there was very competent and corrected the issue right away. We will drive 100 miles to the next emergency hospital before we ever take one of our pets back</Text>

<review>This place needs to be shut down. They care only about the business and not about the well being of the animals. My dog died not even 2 hours after seeing the doctor. Everyone needs to know about this. They deserve no stars and to be put down. They are fast to take all the money, but not fast to help your pet.

My boyfriend took his dog in last night 05/21/2018 and they told him they couldn't help his dog because he has a personal relationship to me (due to the fact that I made a complaint about the dog I described above). His dog had a dislocated disc during after hours and this company wants to protect the business but how about the pets. You should at least offer a waiver that people can sign .

Law actions need to be taken against this location and maybe even all of VCA.

You are so ignorant for copying and pasting the same response to all of the people sharing their opinions and experience .</review>< pictures>

I had to bring my 16 yr old boxer here since my regular vet was not in. They immediatly took her back to triag and assessed her because she was in alot of distress. We consulted with the vet and she was very good at expaining things to us. Never did she push us to run a bunch of test. Our Dollys condition was not good and we made the heartbreaking decision to euthanize. This was an agonizing decision to make and everyone there was so nice and truly, genuinely sympathetic. They gave us all the time we needed to say our goodbyes.  The technicians were very patient and kind. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. I was charged the office visit and for the euthanasia  which cost less than it did to put my 17yr old Dacshound down.  To me their prices are no different than our personal Veterinarian. Thank you VCA Valley Animal Medical Center for making a heartbreaking situation easier.< /Text>

Although grateful that this VCA clinic is open 24 hrs., I must say that it is quick to make sure you purchase everything.  Yes, I love my dogs; however, diagnosis by the emergency vet does not align with what my primary vet states.  It‚Äôs like saying my VCA vet is misleading me. Two stories not good, and leveraging your weakness at the same time.  My advice. Don‚Äôt buy medications from the emergency after hours clinic unless your animal would DIE like today without taking it. Your primary vet knows your animal‚Äôs health best.  In other words, use more common sense than I because you will not be able to return that expensive drug once you discover it‚Äôs not necessary. That sucks due to CA law.

The staff is friendly, but I can sense a cutting too.  It‚Äôs an interesting dichotomy to say the least.< /review>

They shouldn't even get a star. Dealt with them at two separate locations. Indio and Rancho Mirage. Rude and nasty. Felt as if they could care less about the health problem I had with my dog. The office staff needs to be taught manners and how to deal with people, because they have none. I will never take any pet there again.</Text>

We‚Äôre told by the receptionist we could just do a walk-in for the wellness check up we needed to get our dog into Mexico.  We showed up and were told we need an appointment to do that.  That‚Äôs why we called up front folks!!! And, they can‚Äôt do it today, we drove over 30 miles to find this out?</Review>

<Text>We had an incident with our do around 4 in the morning. After searching on line we were surprised to find VCA in Indio was the only 24 vet. We arrived around 5. After filling out a form we were told the wait would be about 45 minutes as it was shift change and the doctors were doing rounds. After about an hour wait a doctor came in to examine our dog. We were trying to explain that we felt that based on what happened we thought he had an allergic reaction to something. The doctor kept focusing in on him vomiting but we kept trying to explain what had happened and how we were more concerned about his sneezing and breathing. She did a cursory exam and then left to work  up a treatment plan, The tech came back with a plan for a shot for nausea, multiple xrays and a radiologist report that would cost almost $800 dollars. We asked to discuss it with the doctor but were told we had already talked to her. Our main concerned was what sounded like wheezing to us so we asked if the doctor heard anything. The tech did not go ask her but said he did not hear anything when he listened. My husband and I discussed it and asked for his symptoms to be treated including Benadryl  for the sneezing and possible allergy. Our bill ended up being approx. $260. Other than still sneezing our dog seems to be fine and not in need of expensive X-rays. I feel they use the emergency patients as a way to make money. We paid $150 for 5 minutes of the doctor‚Äôs time. We will see our regular vet it needed. It is unfortunate that there are no other options for emergencies in the area.
Update: I emailed the person suggested by the owner in his response. I did dot receive a response after 5days. Very disappointing.</Text></record>

<review>We were sent to VCA by our vet with our Mini schnauzer with extremely high glucose levels. When we got there we were very concerned and I feel that they prey on those emotions. They gave us an estimate of $2400 said we needed to pay a deposit which was $2400 immediately. They estimated he would be their only until the next day and when he got sicker during the night they called us and said they would call us again for another estimate for him to stay a few more days. At this point my husband and I got in our car and drove over and demanded to see not only our dog but also speak with the vet. After seeing our dog and how miserable he was we made the excruciating decision to put him to sleep. We were questioned by the staff and made to feel almost guilty about making that decision. I have no idea how many more thousands of dollars it would have been to keep him there. This is our only option here in The Valley and it is a horrible 1. All they care about is the money not the animal and they should be shut down.</review>< Time>

This place is the worst! I brought my pug in late at night with an eye injury/his eye had come out of it‚Äôs socket. It is so important to act quickly in this situation, the eye needed to be put back into place as quickly as possible to minimize the damage. This is supposed to be an emergency hospital but Kristi Medearis chose to do nothing! Instead of doing the right thing, she stalled and tried to convince me that an expensive eye removal surgery could be a better option. Once she realized that I could not come up with the 2700. in the middle of the night she began to belittle me, repeatedly referring to me as ‚Äúpeople with money problems‚Äù.  By the time she ‚Äútried‚Äù to tend to his eye, she said she couldn‚Äôt do anything, it had become too swollen. Too much time had gone by. She then suggested that I consider surrendering my dog.
I knew I had to get him out of this place, they did not care about my dog at all. The $775. bill that I paid that night was full of bogus fees and a ‚Äúmiscellaneous professional service fee‚Äù....Disgusting!
Fortunately, I was referred to an amazing Veterinary Hospital in the morning. A very skilled and compassionate DVM fixed my pug, she even saved his eye.
My heart aches for any animal or pet owner who has to go through this. Unfortunately, there are so few choices when something happens to our pets at night. Please beware of the VCA in Indio, the focus is on $ NOT the animal.< /text>

Overall, I think their professionalism, attention to detail and customer service is poor.  After $1,700 in treatment etc., a test for lyme disease was ordered on Thursday and she was started on doxycycline which is a strong antibiotic and is great in case she has lyme disease, but if she doesn't have lyme disease, she absolutely shouldn't be taking it.  Due to their advice, we took her to a vet in Ontario, CA (their service is REMARKABLE!!) for further diagnosis and treatment.  Found out her test was sent out on Saturday....why???  Test takes several days, so she has to take a potentially harmful medication longer.  There is more to the story, but never got a call back from a vet. I have seen on some reviews that this vet  will respond to some of the poor reviews, instead of responding to mine, here is a suggestion, when people are spending a lot of money trying to save their loved on...CALL THEM, KEEP THEM INFORMED, DON'T JUST HAVE THE DESK CLERK SAY THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THE TEST WASN'T SENT OUT UNTIL SATURDAY AND HAVE A NICE DAY.   At Ontario, they have initiated a phone call to us approximately 6 times over the past 2 days.  VCA in Indio has  low Google rating because you earned it!<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Horrible experience. Took my poisoned dog in with internal bleeding. Sat in lobby with NO ONE else waiting ahead of me for 2 hours.  Then they put me in an exam room and said the vet would be with me shortly.  An hour later and I'm still sitting in the exam room.  Went to front desk and told them vet needed to take care of me immediately or I would leave.  The receptionist said fine, go. Up all night till a local vet opened at 8 am(carter animal hospital) walked in wo appointment and they took him to the exam room within 15 minutes, did blood work, had him on a saline flush and treated with poison antidote and I was on the way home at 915 am.  Never go to VCA clinics.  They are the bottom of the pit and the people staffing them don't know what they are doing.  I agree with a previous poster.  They should be shut down.  File a complaint with the state vet board Like I have done to close this dump down<//text>< Pics>

After a recent serious accident with our dog, we took him to the VCA Valley Animal Medical Center Emergency Hospital. As far as we are concerned, this place saved the life of our dog. The surgeon, Dr. Trousdale was incredible, caring and considerate; the staff amazing. Kudos to Seth, Ashley and Jonathan to name a few. While our dog is still recovering and the long term rehab uncertain  -we are so incredibly grateful - words can not describe their love and attention for our pet Rufus. 5 stars.< /review>

My Am Staff came in the house right after we went to bed, she has a doggie door and comes and goes as she pleases, I heard her throw up and turned on the light and the left side of he head was swollen up big time, she was having trouble breathing, I called all the vets I knew in Imperial Valley and finally got a hold  of one who was out of town but told me to give here benadril to slow the swelling and he recommended VCA in Indio which is almost two hours from us.  Well we were out of options so at around 10PM away we went, when we got there we were immediately served.  The vet took our dog in, gave her a shot and watched  her for an hour, she was much better so we took her home arriving at 3AM.  Long night
Bottom line VCA was courteous, efficient and considering the hours reasonable would give them at least four stars, I just wish they were closer< /text><username>Jim O'Malley</username>< Rate>

This is a terrible place for any pet owner. Please stay away as YOUR PET COULD DIE as a result of their negligence and incompetence.  On Monday evening, I took in my  pug of 7 years old due to him swelling up from his rear, complications when attempting to go potty and infection around that area. He was fine on Sunday, so I knew right away this was an emergency situation.  I could not get same day appointments with our regular vet or other vet clinics in the valley. I  scheduled appointments for Tuesday but decided to visit this 24 hour pet hospital since it was clearly an emergency situation. They told me he was overheated and the swelling would go down over time. They charge me $165 for the visit and told me we could go home. The next morning, he did not look any better and the swelling became worse. I had my first scheduled appointment on Tuesday at 3:00 p.m. The new place I took him to, told me that he had an enlarge prostate and had become infected. His bladder was full of urine and was about to explode. He could have died if I waited more time to take to a vet. He needed an emergency surgery to remove the fluid from his bladder and glands. He stayed overnight. The clinic called me today that they could not perform surgery on him and the best thing to go is put him down. His prostate became over inflamed due to the electrolytes injected by the VCA.  He did not need any more liquids. This cause his prostate gland and abscesses to rupture. If he would received proper attention on Monday evening by VCA he possibly could have been saved. Now our family lost our beloved pet. I have to tell my five year old son his dog has to be put down. Please avoid this place at all costs.</text>

<review>I found staff to be competent, caring and professional. And the vet herself was nothing but compassionate as she worked with me to try to find a solution for my dog's Irritable Bowel Disease.

Tests are expensive everywhere, and this vet is no exception; however, they were done quickly and results were immediate, giving me invaluable information that helped me make decisions. I did wind up having to put my beloved little companion to sleep after all the medications quit working, and I can tell you they were wonderful to me and to my dog. The vet had tears in her eyes and said good-bye with me as I held him and felt him slip away. A sad, inevitable part of life, made easier by people who really care.<//review>< Pics>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>The care my pet received was competent, but they seem to take advantage of a stressful situation and recommend unnecessary and expensive procedures.  My pet was treated for a bite wound and was sent home with an expensive prescription for a liver medication not remotely related to the bite wound.  My primary care vet said it was totally unnecessary given the age of the pet and the liver enzyme which was elevated wasn't that elevated, but the VCA vet said 'could be an indication of cancer', which is alarming.  They also sold me a $150 bacteria culture to ensure the pet was given the right antibiotic, but it takes 5-7 days for the results--my pet is responding fine with the current course of meds, so that was another wasteful and unnecessary procedure.  Next time I will go to the emergency vet in Banning which is not part of VCA and doesn't appear to have profit as their only focus.  If you do have to use VCA make sure you question every charge and don't be intimidated to decline them if they don't seem justified.</review>< Pictures>

I've heard a lot of bad comments about this clinic. We were in need of an emergency vet care for our dog last night. We called n they told us to get there now. My service dog was having grand mall seizures. His health had been going down hill and he suddenly could not get up and was having seizures.  We are seniors and have a very limited income so we did not have the money to do costly tests n treatment that more than likely would not do anything but prolong his life but not with quality of life. So we sadly made the choice to let him go.
The staff was compassionate and allowed us to do the right thing for our seriously ill dog.  We are sad but know we made the right decision.< /text>

<text>Was a little standoffish at first coming here after reading these reviews but I‚Äôm so glad we did.
Our poor Lyla had gotten into something and her face was swelling. We called and asked if they could see her and they of course said yes bring her in. We had to drive an hour from where live due to this being the only emergency animal hospital close to us but we brought her in anyways. We were there for about an hour and a half however we were spoken to by 4 different people all keeping us updated! The Vetenarian Kristi was amazing and came in and explained everything to us, got her some shots to help the swelling and reaction. And 15 minutes later we got our sweet happy pup back!
Of course it was a bit more pricy than a normal vet visit due to it being 1am and at emergency hours but they were so attentive to Lyla and to us that spending the money to make sure she was okay wasn‚Äôt a problem!
I would totally recommend people to come here for emergencies especially! Just a special shout out to Kristi and Janay for being so kind to my husband and I and treating Lyla as if she were theirs!< /text>< Pics>

My Dog was hurt badly, I believe they knew he would not survive yet they performed many expensive procedures while telling us he would live,he did not I visited him and he was awake and standing up less than 10 hours before he died, IF  they played any role in his premature Death and I Said IF, Then I hope all there's lives are filled with  unlivable pain for the rest of their natural lives.
I hope all the employees at this facility feel the pain and anguish I fell over the past few years, I wish nothing but misery and bad luck to all of them!

<Text>I took my cat to every vet in mexicali and el centro with a total stranger i met on fb for the sole purpose of getting my cat the help he needed. None were open or would take an emergency visit on christmas day. I heard of VCA and rushed over. The vet and nurses treated us so kindly and seemed genuine when they were discussing what my cat might need. In the end i couldnt afford it and they helped me try to get pet insurance to cover it. I was unable to get the insurance. So i had to take my cat elsewhere. A male nurse with a funny name even gave us gas money to make it back home. (I couldnt thank him enough) These people do work hard and care about the pets coming into their unlike all the other vets i went too. However their young blonde female receptionist was rude to us, and had terrible customer service skills. She made us feel bad for not coming in sooner and for even going in on christmas day. I lived in el centro with no car and had never even heard of this place until someone told me about it and we immediately made the trip over to Indio. I did everything i could for my cat. I just wish he were here today. He showed no symptoms until it was too late. I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart for going to work on christmas day in 2016. I know its frustrating and stressful when your work goes unappreciated.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>Good veterinary services are hard to find, most are all about the money. Not Dr. Truesdale. He is wonderful, the staff is great and there is more concern for your animal them your wallet. Other vets ought to take a lesson from this wonderful veterinary clinic and hospital. They have called to check on my girl every week. Dr. Trousdale visits the closest city to my home about every 5-6 weeks. They called to let me know when so I could bring my KatieBear to see our hero. He's the best and so is the clinic. *****</text>< Name>

<Review>I spend over 2000 dollars and they killed my dog!!!.. My dog was having complications so we took her here. The doctor came out she said the dog was in bad shape and they coulda anything until I sign and pay infront. They did nothing but sedate my dog and waited to die in there. Her sugar levels were high and they said they were going to control it by lower it little by little. I pay them 2000 and a hour pass thwy came back and told me ‚Äúwe need to start the treatment‚Äù so we are ganna need you to sign a second waver that I needed to pay $5000 on top of what I gave them before to start the treatment. I said WHAT?! So what have you been doing all this time?They said they were treading her but when I went back I saw my dog in a bed sedated compulsing with no one around and no one taking care of my poor baby. She die after a few hrs so I took her home. I came back to pick up my dog collar (the last thing I had left of her) and they didn‚Äôt have it. I waited for 2 hrs and they throw it away! The manager said we don‚Äôt have it but wait for it they told me they could give me 50 dollars back as an apology and I told them ‚Äúis this a joke?‚Äù I was furious and so disappointed that the only memory from my dog was thrown away like a meaningless pice of trash. Imagine someone dying and the doctor telling you oh yea we throw everything away because it die. That‚Äôs how I felt and I don‚Äôt want anyone else to go through what I had<//Review>< pictures>

I have been to this vet 2-3 times. a few years back I took my 3 yr old Chow in about 4 years ago. He wasn't eating, and very lethargic. They tested him for Parvo. They said he tested positive and that it would cost over a 1000 dollars to start treatment there in the clinic. I was also told I could take home meds and treat him. That would cost $500. I opted to do that. Then I thought "I can't afford this. I paid for my   doctors visit and left, without any medication. I sobbed all the way home. The next morning my dog was perfectly healthy again. We took him to our previous vet in San Bernardino, (where we use to live) he said  this dog doesn't have anything wrong with him. He probably ate something that disagreed with him.  First of all, I hate to think I would have paid all that money,  and 2nd, what would that medication do for a perfectly healthy dog. Worst scenario would have been if he'd been put down. Totally misdiagnosed my dog. Only after Money.

Last February (2018) we took our Chiwennie in because she was having seizures. It was after hour so emergency fees of $150.00 is charged for just walking in the door. Then 3 hours later after they gave her some meds we needed to see the vet. we sat and waited another hour.  Finally we spoke to the vet, they really didn't have any answers. I decided to take my dog with 3 days worth of meds. (knew I could get meds cheaper on line) and left. This cost us $375.00. They didn't say what caused this condition, but they were prescribing her meds to be taken daily. My dog hasn't had anything like a seizure since February, (6 months ago) . Obviously no meds were needed. Seems like a guessing game to them and our animals suffer the consequences. In 2 visits meds were prescribed and both times they weren't needed. My dogs are healthy, but not from anything this place did. It's shameful they're still in business. From reading the reviews of others, the bad out weighs the good here. Stay Away.< /review>< Pics>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>I cannot share enough praise and thanks for the staff, vet techs and veterinarians at VCA Indio. My cat, Spidey, swallowed a needle and thread and needed an x-ray, then an emergence endoscopy and ultimately abdominal surgery (they saved him! He‚Äôs ok!)

This all happened between 10pm-3am, and I was distraught, anxiety-ridden and exhausted. Everyone at VCA was not only knowledgeable and helpful, but also incredibly compassionate towards me in my messy/sorrowful state. They were clear and concise with my options and explained processes in a comprehensible way. It‚Äôs amazing to have someone meet you where you‚Äôre at mentally. I‚Äôm sure I asked them to repeat explanations 100x but no one ever seemed to tire of me. They were SO helpful with billing, and helped me figure out my pet insurance (Trupanion, who were also amazing). It‚Äôs worth saying that they also have options for those without insurance, a credit card w/a high interest rate but a 12-36 month period to pay off debt before that kicks in.

Spidey was SO well taken care of. I felt that they showed him just as much love as I would have, and because of the swiftness and expertise of vet techs, the vet, and the surgeon, Spidey made it out of a very dangerous mistake with his life intact.

Recovery was really intense with him at home, and I had lots of questions for the folks at VCA. He had an unexpected bump of swelling and I had other Qs as well, anytime I called, someone was able to speak with me briefly to give instructions in less than 5 minutes of hold time on the phone.

VCA staff, vet techs, Spidey‚Äôs many vets, and especially Erica, we cannot thank you enough. We owe you his life, and I will always appreciate your love and care towards us both.</text></record>

Well we almost put her down for almost 450$.! Yea it was extremely high, and they haven't taken her blood to see if she was   dying. Just put her down and give me your money. Then on top of everything they wanted me to shut my dog up (quote) because she barked to much. I could not imagin the torture they would have put her threw before they put her down. He was a bald short man with tattoos. And a Hispanic female assistant. In the end we waited till morning which they said was impossible to do, and took her to a vet in desert hot springs. They were close to closing on a Friday when they immediately took my dog and began to flush her body and take blood samples. Before I paid or gave them my information. I was so grateful that I didn't listen to the

Took my sick dog in at 5:30PM to the Rancho Mirage location!  They are open until 7PM.  They tell me I have to take him to the Indio location because it was too close to closing time to be able to help my dog.  I take him to the Indio location and get there at 6:10.  They wanted to charge me Emergency rates because it was 10 minutes after 6PM.  I explained that I was sent by there other location, which was open until 7, and they did not care.  The receptionist was cold and had the attitude that she did not care what so ever.  If that is a reflection on there service I would NOT take your animals there.

We went in frantic after our Lulu was viciously attacked by several Pit Bulls.  The staff jumped into action and took Lulu from us and administered medical care.  While we were waiting for the Vet to access Lulu's injuries, several different staff members were coming in periodically to give us updates and console us.  We had to make the difficult decision to euthanize her and my 13yr old and I were devasted.  The staff couldn't have been nicer to us.  This situation was horrible for our family but the staff at this hospital was exceptional.<//Review>

<text>Back in october 2015, i brought in my best friend, a black lab named Duke...he had difficulty breathing & his belly was swollen. The vet assistant did the preliminary check & with out hesitation he retrived one of the on-duty vets & they took Duke to the emergency area to provide oxygen for him as he was suffocating due to internal bleeding. This devistated me to no end because i knew this was the end of my best friend Duke's life....the Dr's, vet assistants & front reception staff all helped to make a heartbreaking situation a little easier to bare, because we had to make the decision to put him to sleep due to his in-operable condition. Thank you VCA hospital for not only being professional, but caring & very helpful during one of the worst days of my life...the death of my best friend, hunting companion, & family member Duke.</text>< pictures>

<Date>1504575932910<//Date><text>The only reason I didn't give 5-stars is because of a previous experience we had with this VCA location. The first time we brought our dog in after a dog bite we saw Dr. Kingsley and when we didn't go with the invasive and expensive surgery that she wanted us to do, she did 3 tiny staples to close his wound and sent us home with a packet of antibiotics. Our regular vet was surprised that there were only 3 staples and when we came back into the VCA after our dog re-injured the area, the staff there seemed surprised that he only had 3 staples for a wound of that size. Our 2nd experience was with Dr. Baumgard and his assistant Rebecca, who were absolutely amazing and took care of our dog from the moment we arrived until they called for us to pick him up after they cleaned him up and SEWED the wound shut. This is the treatment he should have had from the very beginning. This option was not offered to us during our first visit. I will come back to this location ONLY if Dr. Baumgard is on duty. I have absolute confidence in him and the services he provides to his patients. I would recommend him and Rebecca to anyone.

My son took our cat there at 2am because the cat was having difficulty breathing. The doctor on call said that the cat had an upper respitory infection, and that tests in excess of $750 needed to be run before the cat could be treated. When my son asked if the doctor could just prescribe an anti-biotic or something to help the cat breath better until it could be seen by its regular doctor on Monday, the doctor refused. What is the emergency fee visit for? To diagnose the cat but not treat it without additional exhorbant charges? This place seems to try and take advantage of pets that become ill after hours by charging ridiculous amounts of money for something relatively easy to treat....like a cold! I'll drive to Redlands before I go back here again.< /text>

Came to this VCA location despite everything i hear about VCA staff not truly caring for animals well being and there services being unreasonably exspensive. My terrier mix ingested 18 ibuprofen pills and had not been showing signs of being affected by them.All other vets had already closed and this was the only location that was still open and was 24 hours.So i find myself here where upon speaking with the lady at the front desk they are already telling me it would be cheaper to put her down rather than seek care. I came to this terrible place to try and save my dogs life. I would have stayed home and let her die in comfort if that was the case. So I get talked into applying for carec redit and I get approved and both the females that are part of the night staff seemed to be excited ,money makes these people move.They then began to weigh my dog and get a room ready for us. After speaking to the veterinarian and waiting for them to prepare bloodwork and have me call a poison control center, that charged me 65$ to tell me nothing, I begin to get restless and concerned. Leah ,my dog, seems to be uncomfortable and continously is barking. The assistant also  makes a comment that she is like that because they took her temperature when they weighed her using a thermometer for your butt and is laughing when he says this. I begin to think to myself am I really going to trust this creep with Leah? Hell no!! So I tell the lady at the front desk with glasses that I no longer want to seek care using your vet . The vet would like to speak to me ,Im sure to try and convince me to spennd money there but send his assistant to tell me and not himself. Leah at this point is barking at the assistant who enjoys the discomfort dogs get when a thermometer is in there butt.He starts to tell me"" this is a hospital your dog cant be barking like that" and tells me to "you have to tell him no" "yank his leash" and trys to show me how to yank a dog so it hurts the dog. I give the guy a look and start to leave he then says "your going to leave?" "are you serious?" . I reply "your complaining about my dog" "So yeah I'm going to take her outside." "I'm coming back" . He says "your not telling it no" You have to tell them". Before heading out the door I stop and firmly tell him "Don't tell me how to take care of my dog". "Are you serious" he says I then walk out and return to my car where my family is waiting and I say lets go. The following day I took Leah to my local veterinarian hospital in Desert Hot Springs where they immediately began to give her care when i walked in the door withtout even verifying I coukld afford it. They even went as far as too stay after hours with Leah to make sure everything was going well. This is the care you expect when your dog ,who is as much a part of my  family  as my 15 year old sister is, is in critical condition. Bottom line VCA is all about their money and isn't nearly as proffessional and caring as other places in the desert valley. I would go here only if it meant life or death otherwise steer clear of this chain of vets.</Text>

<Review>I dont even know where to start. My pitbull puppy ate a pack of gum and we rushed here it was during emergency hours so we had to pay to take my dog in.
2. Dr. Was in a bad cranky mood. Seemed not to care.
3. We were there for hours not knowing what was going on.
4. They made ME call poison control which was 65$ ,they gave me the number wrong 3 times!( they should have called themselves)
5. The fact that they didnt know what to do so they had me call poison control says it all.
6. After they enduced my pup to trow up she came out perfectly fine, But! They tried convincing me to waste MORE money to get her all this other unnecessary stuff.
7. Seems to me they dont even care about your dog they just care about the money.
8. Only good thing was the office lady was nice.
I dont like talking bad about a place but this place was ALL BAD .
We came her one more time to give it a last shot(hoping for the best) to check out some bumps my dog had and they told us they didnt know what they were , which was soo un helpful she was given some pills and shampoo and it made no difference.

My daughter took her dog there they said the dog sprained his leg with no xrays done just an exam for 200.00. The dog was still hurt a week later so my daughter wemt back asking for xrays of left leg. They sedated the dog once with permission three hours later and multiple doses of sedation without informing my daughter they came in with xrays of right side and tried to say they could see through to the left side.  Then they had to give the dog medication to bring him out of sedation. Now its going on five hours and still waiting to get xrays of left side. Then they want us to pay for their obvious mess up. Im looking for the owner of this place because they need to be shut down.<//Review><userid>107161528088531588087<//userid><rating>1< /rating>< pics>

I had one of the worst experiences ever at this vet clinic. When I expressed concern about the bill being high the vet first said I could try taking my dog to Mexicali for treatment or that she would EUTHANIZE MY DOG FOR FREE. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR PET HERE, THEY HAVE NO CARE AND CONCERN FOR ANYTHING BUT THEIR DOLLARS.</Review>

It's yes bring him in . 2 1/2 hours later after waiting they charge us $500 !!! To take care of  an ongoing problem  . Unbelievable  !!!!!! My wife and my little guy have now been there for over 2 1/2 hours to take care of a problem that is a problem after having the surgery . I don't think they need to be shut down as someone else mentioned . I think perhaps new management is the answer . In the Las 2 months we have spent over $2000 dollars here so I think I should be able to speak my mind ........    if management has a problem with that please let me know .

<rate>5< /rate><review>We had THE BEST experience with mobile dog grooming. Russell came to groom our 10 month old "pandemic puppy" for her first time ever. Since she hasn't been socialized much due to COVID, our puppy is fearful of new people and being away from us at home. Russell made it a point to ease her into being comfortable before taking her in the van and having a successful wash and dry. He kept us posted on her progress and comfort level. We 100% recommend The Pampered Pet and we will happily be continuing with their services!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I could not even say enough nice things about Michelle and The Pampered Pet as a whole. They always do an amazing job with my dogs, one of them is insane with strangers and always comes back to her tail wagging. My Boston Terrier always has the folds of his nose cleaned (super important as most places do not take the time to do this). I had been living in Oakland up until recently but still brought my dogs here for grooming when I would come see my Parents. Absolutely love them!< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I have been bringing my pups to Pampered Pets for 5 years.  I do not trust anyone else to care for my fur babies.  Michelle goes ABOVE AND BEYOND for her customers.  She knows every pet and they all love her because they can tell how much she loves them.  The groomers all do a fantastic job.  Pricing is extremely reasonable.  The Spa is very clean and they have a lot of nicely priced packages for your pet as well as a little retail area with cute harnesses, collars etc. If you are new to the area and looking for a groomer who you can trust with your furry family member, someone who will treat them so well they will be excited to see them when you drop them off for a spa day, then Pampered Pets is the place to go!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

When a pet comes in with ticks we do a tick removal in which we take ticks off of the pet and they die during the removal process. Besides that, we have not had to do a tick removal on a pet in a very long time. Further, we disinfect everything before & after each pet. There is absolutely no way your cat would leave our salon with a tick on it, that is outlandish. We would like to know your name and your cats name to check if you even have a file here, I believe you have the wrong salon. What a crazy & ignorant accusation.'}< /Resp>

My pups will not let me anywhere near them with nail trimmers. We've even had instances where they have tried to bite other groomers.  My neighbor recommended Pampered Pet and I popped in last minute with both my dogs today.  They trimmed their nails on the spot without issue and were super nice.   The whole experience was smooth and easy for me and the pups.<//review>

< Review>
I‚Äôve been here only twice but I‚Äôm going a lot more after today. I just came from a few pet places who either could not trim my dogs nails or had to sedate her because of her trust issues. Me and my brother remember the first time we went to pampered pets when I first adopted my dog from the shelter and they were amazing! My fur baby smelled amazing for a long time! So we decided to see if pampered pets can do anything about her nails and trust issue. The main lady (I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt catch her name) knew exactly what to do! She cut my dogs nails on less than a minute and let me hold her! After that she told me no charge!! Best experience at a pet place yet!! I‚Äôm definitely going back!< /Review>

Horrible experience. They called me after I dropped off my dog saying his eyes are popping out and something is wrong. Went to pick him up and he was normal. Maybe a reaction to water or shampoo or stress not sure. They continued with drying and haircut. Went back to pickup and looks like a student worked on him. When asked they said owner was working on him. Asked specifically not to cut too much off face and may be half off body. They don‚Äôt follow directions. Body hair was ok but messed up hairs on face and head. All the hairs were uneven and got trimmed where it didn‚Äôt need to. Please save your self and your baby. Find a place more reliable.<//Text>

<user_name>J. Hernandez<//user_name><Time>1538274106495< /Time><Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I was given one price range over the phone, then brought my dog in and they gave me another price which was more than the price over the phone. Then right before they were going to start they changed the price again. Even higher. When I asked them to explain why they were changing the price again for a second time, they gave me the same excuse as they had for raising it the first time. An older blonde lady working there was also very rude. She said "If you don't like the price then just take your dog." So I did. Then as I was walking out some bald guy working towards the back said "You're just mad because we're charging you more." I did not respond. Then the younger worker who had quoted me the initial price said "Bye" in a very sarcastic voice, as I was walking out. I later found out that the much older guy and woman are the owners, when I came back in to ask for their names. He said "I am the owner" and refused to give me his name. These people are so rude. I'll be calling the BBB on Monday to file a complaint against this place. Very unprofessional staff to say the least. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>My first time here and I'm disappointed. After getting home and looking at my Yorkie I noticed the fur under his eyes was not clean. Still goopy from the normal eye discharge. The other thing that is bothersome is the expectation of a tip before you see your pet. The gal rang me up and asked if I wanted to add the tip. Felt pressured so I did.

They take such good care of my 3 dogs each time I take them.  Michelle is very friendly and my dogs always look great after their baths etc.

In the past they groomed my Samoyed "Simon Moet Chandon" as he was no easy task - but Pampered Pet never batted an eye to groom him and he always came out lovely!!!</text>< pics>

<Review>My weekly Sesame loaf, stays fresh all week and the sour dough whole wheat is out of this world.  The sesame crust tops off the loaf. Ordering online with ease and easy pickup inside the store. This is for Tartine Sycamore in LA.

Food is good. Service needs a lot of work! I ordered a mimosa, mostly orange & a splash of FLAT Prosecco. I complained about it & bartender said he added an appropriate ‚Äúshot‚Äù and the explanation for the flat Prosecco is that it was their last bottle.  People that ordered after us got their order before all of ours was delivered.

Tartine Sycamore needs some training from Tartine Santa Monica on how things should be done.< /Text>

I liked the vibe of the place. Breakfast is like $20. Nice options for bread. Seating is outside due to covid but lot of options as they took a whole lane. Morning bun was good. Salmon Tartine was nice. Small portions for the price you pay. I wasn't very full.</Text>

Tartine, your bread is great but your pastry menu needs a lot of work. The morning bun is a citrus-forward disappointment. I‚Äôd rather not taste an overload of orange zest that completely overwhelms any cinnamon or caramel flavors that I actually want my morning bun to taste like. Their tea cakes are disgusting, the lemon poppy tastes like marzipan, yuck, and the apple walnut is dry as a bone with an overly-crumbly texture, not the moist crumb you‚Äôd hope for with an apple cake that doesn‚Äôt  even taste like apples. The quiche is way too salty and quite boring. It needs something other than greens in it, maybe some caramelized onion or roasted red pepper or gruyere, something to brighten it up a bit. The chocolate chip cookie tastes ok but is flat and hard, and while I do like a crispy cookie it could benefit from a chewier center. The hand pie is hit or miss, sometimes good, sometimes not. The lemon filling full of large pieces of bitter lemon rind is god awful. Unless they‚Äôre Meyer  lemons you really shouldn‚Äôt be putting whole lemon rind in things.The crust they‚Äôve developed for the hand pie also leaves a lot to be desired; it‚Äôs too puffy and more akin to a puff pastry than a pie crust, making it more of a turnover than a hand pie.
On a more positive note, the banana cream tart is amazing as is the pecan tart. The pumpkin tart is also a seasonal favorite. Their scone is probably the best in Los Angeles and the croissants are good too. So it‚Äôs pretty much a toss up, which is why I give 3 stars, because while there is some really good stuff, there‚Äôs also a lot they could improve upon.</text>

Everything was perfect at Tartine as you would expect. But I have a word of warning so you can avoid the confusion we experienced today. Close to the Tartine front door is a walk up window. This window is NOT Tartine! However they sell coffee and pastries so it might not be clear to you like it wasn't to us. We ordered two croissants and coffee at this other non-Tartine establishment and then sat at the Tartine outdoor tables and ate. My husband even said to the lady at the walk up window, y'all hooked us forever when we went to the Manufactory in San Francisco, so happy you are in LA now, we visit here often. The lady replied, that's great! :-| Literally the only way we learned of our mistake was that I decided to buy coffee beans so I said, hey,  let's go inside and see what kind of beans they sell. I asked the employee at the counter what coffee their order window used for cappuccino and he said, oh, we don't have an order window, that's another company next door. Wow. Ok! That explains why they sold "spam and cheese" croissants at the walk up window rather than the expected jambon! Anyway, the other establishment was good but Tartine is perfect.  Believe it. Here's a photo of what we ended up buying and taking home from Tartine (morning buns, plain croissant,  jambon croissant,  apple butter hand pie). And (not pictured), a country loaf.</Text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>Came for brunch with a party of three and a baby. Food came out at sporadic intervals, first to arrive a side order of eggs for one person, 5 min later a quiche for another, 7 min later salad for first person, 10 min later (when other two are almost done eating) burnt French toast for third person.

The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. We are not ones to complain, but the service was completely off the mark. Unfortunately you pay gratuity when ordering, before being served...

The $5 croissant was a hit with the baby.</Text>< Pictures>

Delicious, just like the Bay Area original Tartine. Service was great, and we lucked out on a Monday morning as it was not terrible busy.< /review>

<Date>1576791347168</Date><Text>If I were to base my rating on the croissant, it would be 5 stars - may be the best I‚Äôve ever had (Paris included). But, the staff seemed unhappy to be there and when my food was delivered, I was not asked the standard, ‚Äúcan I get you anything else?‚Äù
Will go back to try other items and gauge whether it was an off day. Will adjust my rating, if need be, accordingly.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I feel compelled to write it in order to forewarn customers  of how they might be treated at Tartin on Sycamore.  Unfortunately, my experience left me feeling hurt & shocked. I only ordered a croissant, a latte, butter & jam, totally $15, excluding tax and tip. That was fine, it wasn‚Äôt fine that as soon I finished my croissant, an employee came up to my table asking if I was having anything else to eat, I replied no, and was still drinking my coffee. He explained there were people waiting that needed my table. I had been looking forward to finishing my coffee and while reading a few pages of my book, but instead, I rushed out feeling awful. I didn‚Äôt mind being charged $2.00 for jam and $2.00 for butter to go with my croissant, I did very much mind feeling insulted and not being able to finish my latte in peace. I won‚Äôt be back.  I‚Äôve never experienced this rude service at Republique, while their ambiance and food is superior to anything they offer at Tartine, plus they don‚Äôt charge you $4.00 extra for jam and butter.<//Text>< rate>

Lovely customer service and the hot chocolate was perfect. Its really busy and take out is the way to go. The crowd was somewhat hipster obnoxious, ie there was a guy standing in the middle of the doorway with his 2 dogs blocking everything who acted irritated when I said excuse me.<//Review>

This place is perfect when you want to get away from living in LA. Sure it‚Äôs overpriced carbs but they have an amazing dining area where are you literally feel encouraged to relax and socialize for an hour or two with your friends or bring a book and a laptop and never feel pressure to make room because there‚Äôs plenty of it.</text>

Incredibly rude staff and very selective about who can stay or who should pack up and leave. I can buy their rubbery breakfast sandwich at any bagel and get a smile from the cashier.  Save your money.<//Review>

<Text>It is gorgeous and kid-friendly since its renovation a few years ago. I have actually gotten choked up watching children of all ages (it's a busy and popular park), playing their various games, little kids playing in one area, bigger kids being coached on the court, not a care in the world, chaperoned by teachers/mentors/parents, in this perfect little park where once no one felt safe day or night, and dirty syringes and condoms littered the place. It was a magical transformation. There is even an indoor recreation area with a restroom.</Text>< Pics>

Beautiful redone park with very nice basketball courts. People do Ti-chi every morning and it brings peace to the park. There is a huge huge colorful mural on the east wall of the park that is park appropriate. Only one entrance in and out. Wich I personally believe cuts down on crime. VERY, very close proximity to the police station and a very nice bathroom. Lots of kids play here all the time for a great atmosphere üëçüëçüëç‚òÄÔ∏è</Review>

Nice clean bathrooms. But staff can be annoying. I used to come for coffee in the morning. The program was run by some crazy lady. All she did was yell at everybody. No fun. Then they had a bogus meeting to discuss what people would like to see in the mural before it was even designed. Some people had some pretty solid ideas. Yet none of those ideas went into the final rendition. All I wanted for was the artist to paint a few shamrocks to represent the Irish community. And they refused. The theme of the mural is Everybody Deserves a Home. But take a good hard look. Do you see any people? I rest my case.<//Review>

I actually really enjoyed being at this park with my two boys. And my small boy misplaced his backpack and someone found it and instead of stealing it they took it to the help desk so I really appreciate this place. Thank you guys!!<//text>

Safe children's playground. Basketball ball court. Tables and a small picnicking and grass activity area. Outside exercise installation. Small garden. Usually has neighborhood families playing during evenings and weekends with attendants to keep the place safe. Local neighborhood school classes visit during the day. Sometimes holds events for the community, like a day camp today which brought a climbing wall, bikes, skateboards, and generally brought a lot of life to the neighborhood.<//review>

It's a good place but not well maintained. The artificial play area is so dirty. Kids roll in it and I'm worried they might fall sick. Management needs to take care of cleanliness.< /Review>

There are exercise machines, a table tennis table, walking route, & basketball court.  If you just want to rest or relax that you can also do.  All kinds of people are there.  But you still need to be on your toes.  It is in the Tenderloin neighborhood.< /Review>

<Response>None</Response><Rate>5<//Rate><review>A lovely little park nestled into the dirty, gritty Tenderloin. It is a great place to bring a lunch, grab a table, and surf a good quality wireless network. One can also go inside the lobby and sit inside when the weather prohibits outdoor leisure. The clubhouse often has tea and snacks, and there are actual CLEAN PUBLIC TOILETS that anybody can use (a rare gem in the TL)! Overall, this rebuilt green space provides a safe place for children (or adults) to play, and a somewhat quiet and relaxing spot to contemplate the Tenderloin neighborhood around you.< /review><user>107435592141217125450< /user><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

Great clean lovely city park in the heart of the Tenderloin.  Perfect for picnics, basketball, strolling, table tennis, exercise, reading and playing.  Sounds of children laughing and playing add joy to the park.  Great community center and clean restrooms. Nice, safe and modern.  A great neighborhood park.<//Review>

<text>Amazing park, just redone in Fall of 2014 and has way more than just the clubhouse.  Swings, playground, basketball court outside, there are places to sit and enjoy being outside while in the Tenderloin, really!   check out the area tucked in the center of the block, a nice refuge from the bustle of the surrounding area.
You will be amazed by the diversity, life and substantial number of just normal people getting out and playing here.</text><Resp>None< /Resp><UserId.>108673059277097287288< /UserId.>< Pictures>

This park was part of my visit to San Francisco when I went to Union Square. I went over by the park and through the park I used to live there around the corner from the park or down the street rather on Eddie at the Roosevelt Motel. Hey it was only $500 a month bathrooms down the hall so where the showers but that San Francisco for you! Cost a lot to live there but the park was great it brought back old memories some good some bad go by there one day when you're in San Francisco Eddy Street ain't the best street in the world. It has its problems just like a lot of the places downtown San Francisco. If you ever get the chance to visit there I think you'll like it!<//text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>This Park has gone under a transformation of great magnitudes. Gone are the dark hidden corners and sketchy persons lingering around within its borders.
In are the new Clubhouse, yes clubhouse,
The grounds are well kept, time for a picnic.
There are new basketball courts with all the trimmings.
Playgrounds for the children.
Grass knolls strategically placed throughout the Park.
Boeddeker Park 2015 is a jewel of a park now. Worth taking the kids to play and learn.
Bonus, the Sun shines Mid-day so bright.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Newly renovated in December 2014, with a clubhouse, grassy area, and basketball court. The play area has two swings, a rope structure, and a terrain area with a roller slide. Also the best sounding children's chimes ever. A bit too hot and sunny though.<//Review>

It is usually an island of serenity, amongst the torrid wickedness that is the sleazy parts of San Francisco's Tenderloin.

Although, oddly there are places mere feet apart - in the park where data/talk reception plummets to zero from excellent. Which may seem static and unchanging, yet hours or a day later, the pattern changes abruptly. Possibly due to local demand on the few transponders that services the Tenderloin.
So be sure to activate your WiFi to lock onto SFWIFI, there is no password as it is a public service provided by the city. Although service is limited to the vicinity of the park. FYI it is also the same WiFi when you are in or around the city libraries.

BTW, the reason there is the occasional reek of bathroom cleaner, is because the Dept of Public Works, routinely washes down the sidewalks of problem areas (almost all of the Tenderloin) because of human waste contamination. Watch your step when wandering outside of the park, I'm not kidding.<//review>

The dealers and druggies will always be the most prevalent activity in this park no matter how much money is spent.
Too bad the TL is losing kids according to the census
I am not surprised since so many of them become latchkey kids and become prisoners in their own home because of the dangerous activities that never end on the streets.
Face it Glide is next to Boeddeker and that draws too many thugs on drugs
The police station does not help they still blatantly deal drugs when the cops leave
The kids notice the activity
The JC Decaux bathroom is nothing less than a CRACK SHACK
This was not the case in the 60s through most of the 70s and the crack epidemic and the proliferation of liquor stores has destroyed the neighborhood
Skid Row was on Second Street when I was A kid
Now it is 6th Street ,most of the TL and some of the Mission and Bayview.
Skid Row has grown< /Text>

Tom McClintock and his staff came through for me in a huge way to get a passport appointment on short notice when every passport agency in CA turned me away and said it was not possible. I am grateful for their urgency, care and execution.  They were happy to help.</review>

I have know the Congressman for many years and have met with him on many occasions to discuss issue of concern to the real estate community. While he may not always agree with our position, I believe he truthfully stands on what he believes, is articulate, and understands the issues.<//Text>

I really appreciated reading your perspectives on how our governor is overstepping his authority.

We are following CDC and state guidelines.  We wear a mask when inside, shopping, and unable to keep distanced from others outside.  When we‚Äôre on a walk or hike...  masks are off and are unneeded since no others are in our proximity.

We walked into a Costco yesterday...  the store was jammed and had limited parking.  Everyone was wearing masks and trying their best to social distance - WHY ARE WE LIVING IN SUCH INCONSISTENT TIMES???

1st...  let‚Äôs follow the guidelines
2nd... let‚Äôs get our kids back to school-government officials need to hold school unions accountable!
3rd... let‚Äôs open back up our country
4th... AND respect the office of the president, senate and Congress, and quit the divide.  WAY TOO MANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS DON‚ÄôT bring us together!</Review>

<review>Terrible at math, doesn't understand basic science and doesn't seem to realize he lives in California.  He's too concerned with rural constituents that live in Iowa and the mid-west.  His vote for the tax overhaul helped strip millions in wealth from my community of high income, high taxed earners. The fact he doesn't even live in the district he represents ads to his detached voting record.  An embarrassment to public service and freeloads his paycheck delivering absolutely nothing to constituents.</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x809ae1f4ffffffff:0x316e8149f16f532</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Tom is a proud member of this mentally weak, morally weak, integrity deficient, racist, anti American, and now Authoritarian co-opted Republican Party.
It‚Äôs disgusting to watch McClintock‚Äôs blinky eyed and deafening silence while trump systematically attacks the pillars of our American justice system, law enforcement, free press, military hero‚Äôs, and ultimately our American and world democracy... his ongoing non action are clear signs of tom‚Äôs own moral ineptitude, his mentally weak understanding of our country‚Äôs constitution, and his surrendering to authoritarian rule.

This can no longer be allowed.  From this day on... Tom and his zombie followers will never live another peaceful day until Tom makes two things happen.
1. Denounce trump entirely and unequivocally. Period
2. Write a letter to the speaker of the house demanding impeachment proceedings start immediately.</Review>

Can I give zero ...  after what McClintock said regarding Kavanaugh he does not represent me and my views. I reached out to his office to say that regardless of the outcome Kavanuaghs personality, Political views is not what is needed for the supreme court,  choose a different candidate. Not only did I not hear from his office but now his high regard for a man that doesn‚Äôt behave in the manner a supreme court justice should has deepened my reality that McClintock does not represent me!</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I ordered two drinks via mobile app primarily because I needed to use the restroom. I was informed that the restrooms were closed but that In N Out's were open. Unfortunately, I was not a customer there and had already ordered my coffees. It's very upsetting that they won't let a customer use their restrooms. Waited a longtime too since no one was calling out the finished orders. One nice young man finally took initiative and cleaned out the room of everyone waiting. In the future, I will save myself trouble and go to the Yosemite location.</Review>< Pics>

That's pretty remarkable if you ask me. Plus, the baristas were pleasant as usual. The mad all-day rush did not dampen their mood. It was a pleasant, satisfying experience.

Stopped by during my traveling about 8:50pm got back on the road to to find my drinks weren't made right! Called to speak to Ian to check their hours so I can turn back but he stated they were closed already at 8:55pm and aren't able to assist me! I waited in lined for about 20 minutes just to not be happy with my drinks! Smh.. I don't understand why they can't make a drink just right if they make alot of the same drinks throughout the day. Don't these employees get trained the same way??? Very disappointed! Thanks STARBUCKS for NOT making my drinks rights! Burnt shot & too much cinnamon powder.<//text>

Wow I'd I can place a negative star this place would get one thousand negative stars. Waited over 45 min for my drink by going inside. What's up with this? Comments welcome as this is the longest I've waited at a Starbucks in my whole life.</Review>

For a chain they do ok with the heavy crowds. A little discourteous if you show up in anything other than dress clothes or the latest from the gap or A.e.  I prefer the smaller coffee houses to the big name stores. But it's worth the 4 * review<//Text>

Wouldn't recommend this coffeeshop. I was absolutely disappointed by the speed and quality of service. There wasn't a line inside the cafe, however, I waited around 15 minutes just to get my cappuccino. The priority is a car line. On 1 customer inside the cafe there were 3 in drive-through line. The biggest disappointment was in a quality of coffee.Instead of making coffee with foam, my cappuccino was just a hot milk with coffee. Looks like staff was training how to make the coffee for my money.
Moreover, I asked a couple of times about warm cappuccino instead of hot, and information was added by a cashier. And after 15 minutes of waiting I got my extra hot coffee. There was a label  attached to the drink with "Warm" note, but who cares, right..
For my 4 dollars I'd got some coffee with hot milk.
Was it cappuccino? I don't think so.
Were my request considered? Absolutely, not.
Does anybody care about it except me? No.< /Review>

Very good location, staff friendly and orders almost always done right (quickly fixed if not).

This location is more drive thru friendly, not very spacious inside.<//text>

<Date>1539389981337< /Date><Text>Starbucks is Starbucks so not much to tell you however, service at this location is extremely lacking. Stopped here just this morning on my way to work and let me tell you, I was a minute away from cancelling my order.....that is after waiting 20 minutes! The best part is I ordered a tea, up you read that right, a TEA. One cup of hot water with a tea bag took 20 minutes to prepare. That is just not acceptable on any level and management really needs to hire additional staff to handle the morning rush. Will definitely avoid at all costs.<//Text>< user_id>

Good service and tasty treats! I think you put some secret ingredient in that keeps us coming back and it's not caffeine because I drink decaf. Keep up the good work but it would be nice to lower the price a little.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x809142fe1bbce8c1:0x64862c0122e3115f< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>This specific Starbucks seems to have a lot more issues than others I've been to. From making wrong drinks, taking 10+ minutes to get drinks out, to forgetting to make a drink altogether. On top of that, the staff seems to be more abrasive than others. My drinks/charges seem to come out correct about half of the time.</Review>< Name>

<text>This Starbucks literally always gives us problems with our drinks. Just now I ordered a Venti holiday caramel drink, which is literally 1/3 to 1/2 whipped cream. Most of the time I order a very simple drink--a Venti Americano (or pikes) with cream,and it is a true gamble as to whether the order is burned, inspired, or mixed up in some way. One time they gave me a black coffee with whipped cream, which I am shocked they think a human being that isn't a psychopath would order. My wife has already called the manager ok one time to express her frustration with the issues here, without requesting a replacement drink. We just want good coffee. We will be going to the other one across town now because this is a consistently poor performing Starbucks.<//text>< Resp>

The staff is unprofessional. I literally waited for the cashier to finish her conversation with her friends to take my order. The bathroom and sitting area hadn't been cleaned probably since it opened up that day. There were way too many kids working the day I was there to have customers waiting so long for their beverages. One of our orders was ice water (99 degrees in Merced) I had to go back to remind them to put ice in a cup, run water in it and hand it over. 1 star. Starbucks should be ashamed of this store.<//review>

Starbucks on 16th, Oooo. When presented with choices this is certainly not my 3rd let alone my 1st. Stood in line, with no one else in front or behind me, for well over 3 minutes without even so much as a "We'll be right with you." I literally had to ask for acknowledgement. Not even an order, just to be acknowledged. They then "lost" my drink order. Gave me the wrong size and tried to give me the wrong drink. Let's just say service and quality drinks are not something you should look for at this location.< /Text>

I got my coffee and there wasn't spit in it, so that's cool. Service was good.  I had a free card so I used it. But if you want to support your local community go to coffee bandits on the corner of main and MLK.<//text>

Nice employees. However, I won't fund a company that supports killing babies. I'm not a nutcase. Simply put; I boycott all Starbucks.</review>

<review>I love Starbucks! I always get it! But I did not like today. Business was slow and my coffee was made made very sloppy. I don't understand how. I liked the old workers that they had on Main st. Should've just transferred them to the new one. Never was disappointed by not one of the old workers. Until today by the new one.<//review><GmapID>0x809142fe1bbce8c1:0x64862c0122e3115f<//GmapID>< Rating>

Some would say they couldn't live without it.
I slide through the drive thu almost every morning before class or even work but The Starbucks ‚òï on 360 W.16th St Merced, Cali has a bish ...yeah I said it a bish for Assitant Supervisor. *SOMEBODY CALL CORPORATE* If you don't like , hell love your job to the full extent THEN WHY DO IT!!! #CUSTOMER#SERVICE is most important #1. Very rude. Remember the customers and making them feel comfortable should be your main concern. Ppl skills, work ethics...Race, gender, religion should never be discriminated apon.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x809142fe1bbce8c1:0x64862c0122e3115f< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Worst Starbucks ever! Waited over 20 minutes maybe 25 in drive thru line! So ridiculous! I've been in other busier Starbuck's and they've got my drink in 5 or under! It ain't the 1st time we've had to wait for one drink either. They seem to take their sweeet time and play as well. My frapp lid was also loose, so my drink kept spilling all over hands. Never again will I go to that one.<//review>

I only have one request for them let the customer know when you are out of ingredients for the drink and don't meke it up with random stuff and if you want to work on your computer or smartphone think again there is no public power supply for your devices.< /text>

Asked me if i was going to purchase something before giving me the restroom code. Is it because I walked? I've given plenty of money to Starbucks...maybe not that day, but really people?

drive thru sucks at this location. Always at least a 15min wait from the moment you order to the window. This is the only place that can‚Äôt get the whole drive thru thing down. Disappointed with this Starbucks.< /Text>

<review>Store had issues with general cleanliness on top of issues with getting drinks made in a timely fashion. At time of visit only drive-thru customers were getting drinks made, barista who rang up dine-in customers proceeded to ignore us while also not supporting other baristas on the floor. When we were finally acknowledged no apology was provided in terms of refunds or drink coupons. Severely disappointing service and overall experience.< /review>< pictures>

Went and asked for a decaf Carmel frap. And whatever they made me was NOT a Carmel frap. It was more like a vanilla bean with Carmel on top. If I'm paying 5 damn dollars for a drink I would like if u can actually get my order right. Won't go there again ever such a waist of money!< /review>

Absolutely no plugs to connect to WiFi most people like to drink coffee and have internet access hard to believe I came from Tulsa Oklahoma and they have plenty of plugs for the customer. Don't think I'll go back to that one< /Review>

drive thru sucks at this location. Always at least a 15min wait from the moment you order to the window. This is the only place that can‚Äôt get the whole drive thru thing down. Disappointed with this Starbucks.</text>

I love this Starbucks spot because I've never had any problems. I drive thru here all The Time. The most frustrating thing that could happen to me on a drive thru is not getting what I  want or something in my order missing . When I'm rushing to work or somewhere else, the last thing I have Time for is going back to complain.  my experience on here has been flawless. Great team.< /review>

<Text>Convenient Perfect stop on my way to wrk or out if town, they always busy. The staff doesn't really  listen to your order.  When you have free coupons double check your receipts.  2 out of 3 times charged for my drinks and they kept free coupon.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

It would have a 5 stars but Brandy gives horrible customer service. She served me in a very rude way. She slammed my money back in a bad way. Looks like she ain't even wants to work there. I always go there because the others employees are nice and kind to me.<//text>

I love my Starbucks! Im not a coffee drinker, but love the Chai tea latte, whether I'm in the drive thru or inside the store, there is always a line. But it goes pretty quickly, and the employees are always friendly.</Review>

My first time at this particular Starbucks and it sucked. There was a mistake with my drink ok no problem. The problem was after I told the lady about it her attitude went from sweet to sour real quick. I waited 15 mins in the drive thru just to get a simple frap with coconut milk.<//text>

1. Afraid to get out of my car with the derelicts hanging around.
2. "Forgot to mix in the syrup, sorry." Says the barista.
3. Petite scones were soggy!!
4. Don't go here until Merced cleans up their act.
5. Not one customer before me, or behind me.< /review>

<Text>I dont usually do reviews, but for some reason whenever I come here my frappe always have a funny taste. I always order a Venti Carmel Frappe with extra caramel, but when it comes out there's barely any caramel. Taste plain and really water down. Waited 15mins for my order when it was really slow inside. Its weird because it only happens at this starbucks.</Text>< rating>

Or maybe knows the me√±u aswell as say the employees themselves, dont get ahead of yourselves and be snotty, or too lazy to greet the customer or explain what the product is. Very unsatisfied on the correction of a frapuccino. I asked for no caramel on one and it was packed with caramel, when corrected they did not add the coffee and made a plain vanilla shake for my wife.
*update
that was one bad experience. I have gone back multiple times and it seems they are doing a much better job now. Thank you! keep up the good work! sorry I had to give you a bad review before but you do deserve 5 stars now.< /Review><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Very poor "customer service". Not everyone goes to starbucks all the time. Or maybe knows the me√±u aswell as say the employees themselves, dont get ahead of yourselves and be snotty, or too lazy to greet the customer or explain what the product is. Very unsatisfied on the correction of a frapuccino. I asked for no caramel on one and it was packed with caramel, when corrected they did not add the coffee and made a plain vanilla shake for my wife.
*update
that was one bad experience. I have gone back multiple times and it seems they are doing a much better job now. Thank you! keep up the good work! sorry I had to give you a bad review before but you do deserve 5 stars now.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
I really have a lot of different complaints and disappointments to post but now's not the time. It's too bad because this is the closest, most accessible starbux for my  location and the 6-7 different types of horrible service, treatment by staff and poorly made product would embarrass and infuriate me if I were a  CEO or  distrct/ regional manager of this company. Every time I order a drink its slow, tastes like some other drink and afterwards, when I need to remove the drink I purchased via restroom, I am confronted and told the restroom is only for customers! What a smack in the face. Ignorant, cocky, judgmental, Snobbish and lazy cafe preparers is how I must report of this most unsatisfactory experience with an American favorite. They need a course in work ethics, learn empathy for their variety of customers and start paying attention to who just bought a $4.75 Grande 45 minutes prior before threatening the wrong person to not use the facilities unless "u hurry up and buy." Last note* if u are in a hurry to get a fast cup of Joe before work, etc., I suggest getting a McCafe if you don't have 30-45 minutes to spare...  maybe I will,try one last visit and I'm guessing I will take off another star on the rating aboveüòîsad but ü§îtrue...</review>

<time>1486399904458< /time><Rating>2</Rating><user_name>Bill Sherbert<//user_name><text>Staff was not helpful nor friendly.  We visited about 25-minutes before closing.  The staff was more concerned about getting their chores done than helping customers.  I ordered a venti dark roast, which was unavailable, but waited 18-minutes for the staff to complete my order.  During my wait I needed to use the bathroom, which I told was locked because they just cleaned it.  15-minutes later, after some begging, I was given a piece of paper with a code to the restroom lock. When I received my order, it was served in a grande (smaller) cup.  (I paid for a venti).  I don't think Merced is ready for the Starbucks experience.</text><Pics>None</Pics><GmapID>0x809142fe1bbce8c1:0x64862c0122e3115f<//GmapID>< Response>

I was very dissatisfied with the service I ordered a slice of gingerbread loaf and a slice of pumpkin loaf they never heated them up and they made me wait almost 20 minutes when I was leaving I realized that I didn't have the second loaf they completely forgot very poor service I will not go back there again</review>
